<h2 class="vspace" id="I">I<br />
<span class="subhead">JIMMIE HORGAN’S FORETASTE OF
FORTUNE</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was a splendid office—mahogany, plate-glass
windows and all that pertains to the
uninteresting side of respectability. There
was a lawyer there, sitting before his desk—a
crisp, gray sort of lawyer, who looked as if
when you patted him gently he would snap
a finger off. One Jimmie Horgan was also
there.</p>

<p>Now, Jimmie was a careless youth, and a
cheerful habit of sending people scattering,
acquired by managing the controller in the
employment of the Suburban Trolley Company,
gave him what might be called a cynicobenevolent
view of life. He had learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
that the human body was an unreliable vessel
to hold so great a thing as a soul.</p>

<p>One bunt from his trusty car, and the greatest
alderman who ever received boodle for
that same franchise promptly departed for
Heaven, or its suburban districts.</p>

<p>He had made the proud to skip ahead;
ladies, that one would not suspect of either
agility or pliability, had made creditable running-long-jumps
merely because Jimmie did
not twist the brake. Bankers, plutocrats
and plumbers instantly dropped their accustomed
airs of superiority and hiked out-of-that
when Jimmie’s foot trod the gong. This
showed him clearly that at heart all men were
simple. The airs assumed were but a mask,
concealing a real desire to please.</p>

<p>Jimmie may have belonged to one of the
first families of Ireland, but his estate had
fallen low—so low, in fact, that he held in
his hand the incredible, and now, away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
his platform of authority, he needs must tell
the intrenched lawyer-man a strange tale.</p>

<p>Strong of heart was Jimmie. He rallied.</p>

<p>“Your name Simmonds?” he asked, with a
grimy thumb indicating the signature on the
letter he extended for the lawyer’s inspection.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” barked the lawyer with severity.</p>

<p>“Who gave you that name?” inquired Jimmie
in a spirit of levity.</p>

<p>“What is that?” returned the lawyer.</p>

<p>Jimmie recalled himself to his position.
“Oh,” said he, “I want to know whether this
thing is a fake or not.”</p>

<p>The lawyer extended a hand like a rat-trap,
and snapped the letter toward him.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” he said with decision.
“Certainly not. You have been left, through
his dying intestate, by your maternal uncle,
the sum of five thousand dollars, as I have
acquainted you in this letter.”</p>

<p>The lawyer coughed the cough of consequence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
“This amount is in my care; in fact,
it is deposited in my bank, awaiting your orders.”</p>

<p>Jimmie leaned heavily on the office-boy to
support himself.</p>

<p>“You don’t look it,” he said to the lawyer,
“but are you addicted to the use and abuse
of strong things of any kind?”</p>

<p>“Sir!” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“I slipped my trolley,” said Jimmie. “I
didn’t know I had any maternal uncle.
I didn’t know he had five thousand dollars. I
don’t know where he got it, and I don’t know
where I am, nor why you are here, nor anything
else.” He roused himself. “Say,”
said he, “if you ain’t got me down here to enjoy
my looks, produce.”</p>

<p>“Hey?” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jimmie, “just that. Hay;
make it while the sun shines. Clear weather
to-day. I don’t savvy this thing, up nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
down. You let me have two hundred dollars,
and it will look like business. All I want to
do is to feel it. I have been trying to feel
two hundred dollars for three years, and the
nearest I have got to it is on the instalment
plan.”</p>

<p>The lawyer pushed him a book.</p>

<p>“Make out a check,” said he.</p>

<p>Jimmie swallowed all the air in the room,
but yet made out the check.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at the check in the most
detached fashion, called a man and handed
him the slip of paper. The man seemed
weary. He took the piece of paper, walked
toward an actual safe, opened a drawer with
a real key and pulled out from its secret hiding-place
a bunch, or, as it seemed to Jimmie,
a whole head, of that tender, crisp, succulent
plant, the long green.</p>

<p>With a wet thumb the weary man shredded
off a certain number of leaves, and, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
disgust of life in every feature, placed them
on the lawyer’s desk. The lawyer eyed
them glumly, wrapped them up with a practised
hand, and shoved them to Jimmie.</p>

<p>“There you are, sir,” he said. “Anything
else?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmie dreamily. “No, nothing
else.”</p>

<p>He turned away, bumped into the partition,
begged its pardon most humbly; walked into
a young woman who was approaching with a
basketful of letters; distributed wisdom all
over the office; got spoken to plainly; tried
to help the young woman collect the flying
sheets, and got spoken to still more sharply;
slid down the first four steps outside, landed
in the street in some fashion, and then galloped
toward a sign indicative of a life-saving
station.</p>

<p>After safely embarking on a schooner he
retired to a corner and examined the ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
promises of our government for twenty dollars
per promise, at leisure. They were so.
Boldly he slapped one upon the bar. Doubtfully
the barkeeper opened his cash-drawer.</p>

<p>“No good,” thought Jimmie, thinking this
an act of suspicion. But it was not.</p>

<p>“Say, young feller,” said the barkeeper,
“it’s pretty early in the day to clean me out
of change. Ain’t you got nothing smaller
than that?”</p>

<p>From its lonesome abiding-place at the bottom
of a pocket filled with tobacco-dust,
Jimmie fished out a quarter—that one piece
of Mr. Bryan’s philosophy which he had imagined
to be all that stood between him and
a joyless wait for pay-day.</p>

<p>“All right,” said he.</p>

<p>This proof that it was inability and not contempt
that had shown in the barkeeper’s eyes
burned in James’ heart like a little flame.
He took out one twenty-dollar bill and put it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
in a separate pocket. Twenty dollars he
could understand.</p>

<p>He then made for the barns, wondering
what man it was whose legs carried him so
jauntily.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the great mystery—the
disappearance of Car 809.</p>

<p>How so large and eminently practical a
thing as a trolley car—a thing so blatantly
modern and, withal, so hard and heavy—could
vanish from the face of the earth, and
leave neither track nor rack behind, was a
problem that caused silver threads to appear
amid the gold and bald spots of the officers
of the Suburban Trolley Company.</p>

<p>With it went the motorman and conductor;
gone; vanished; vamoosed; dissipated into
thin air.</p>

<p>The thing was, and then it was not. That
is all they ever knew about it. The facts are
these:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
When James arrived in the yard he approached
his running-mate and poked him in
the chest with a dramatic forefinger. The
running-mate looked at the forefinger and
then at James.</p>

<p>“Changed your spots again?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Nup,” said James, hitting himself mightily
upon the chest. “Here is Willie Wally
Astor, and that’s me.”</p>

<p>“Grounded again?” sniffed the conductor.
“Where do you feel it worst?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t any worst,” said Jimmie.
“You come here!”—and he seized him by the
collar.</p>

<p>“Leggo!” said the conductor, but at the
same time permitting himself to be jammed
into a corner while the golden tale of sudden
wealth was poured into his ears.</p>

<p>“Ah, g’wan!”—but the tones grew weaker
and weaker, and when Jimmie produced his
little pamphlet on high finance, printed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
green—proof to any eye—the conductor fell
upon his neck.</p>

<p>“I allus knew you was the kind of a little
bird that could fly if you drew them feet off
the ground,” he said. “Call the turn.”</p>

<p>“We have got fifteen minutes,” said Jimmie.
“Here we go fresh across the street to
celebrate.”</p>

<p>At this period the minds of both these
worthy men were clear and free from any
further operation than that natural to taking
a drink, but after that first drink, and with the
confidence, bred of another, to believe in that
money, James’ mind extended itself. He
pounded the bar with his fist.</p>

<p>“I am dead sick and tired of going over the
same old streets,” said he. “It occurs to me
at times that I’ll have to turn off som’ers, or
bust.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” assented the conductor; “that’s
right, too. All the time the same streets; all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the time the same old dog that comes just so
near getting pinched; all the time the same
fat man waving his umbrell’; all the time the
same Dagoes with gunnysacks filled with
something, and smelling with a strong Italian
accent; all the time the same war over
that transfer, after that same young lady has
traveled half a mile beyond where she ought
to have got off. If I had another drink I
could feel very bad about this.”</p>

<p>“Let’s,” said Jimmie. So the conductor
felt very bad about it, and Jimmie, like the
good friend he was, felt worse.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said he, “I just naturally will
have to turn off som’ers, or I surely <em>will</em>
bust.”</p>

<p>There gleamed a radiance from the crisp
array before the mirror. Genius had hit
Jimmie—hypnotic.</p>

<p>“Say, Tommie,” said he, “we <em>will</em> turn off
som’ers. If you’ll go me on it we’ll take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
old ambulance clear to the end of everything
in sight this morning. There is more than
forty thousand switches we’d oughter took
long ago, and they can’t stop us. If we get
our jobs excused away from us we c’n lean up
against that five thousand until we are rested.
Come along,” said he, inspiration working.
“Come on, old man!”</p>

<p>“Say,” said the conductor, “I’ve got you
faded. I don’t care if I never work again,
and as for jerking a piece of common clothes-line
every time a person with a mind to shoves
one small nickel into my hand, why, I am
really tired of it. I have had idees of a nobler
life than this, Jimmie. They usually
come after the sixth round, but when I think
of that five thousand—” He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>They grabbed each other and made for the
yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
“Come on, you fellers!” yelled the starter.
“Get a wiggle on. Youse are due now.”</p>

<p>“Comin’, uncle!” said Jimmie, in a sharp
falsetto.</p>

<p>“Slowly comin’!” boomed the conductor.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got a gayness, though?” said the
starter.</p>

<p>The motorman elaborately placed one silver
dollar in the hands of the starter and
closed the latter’s fingers upon it.</p>

<p>“Keep this,” he said, from many years’ experience
of viewing the hero leaving the lady
of his choice with a sob in the orchestra.
“Keep this,” he repeated waveringly, quaveringly
and tenderly. “Do the same by yourself.
This is a sooveniret of something you
never heard of before.”</p>

<p>The starter looked startled. “Well!” said
he. It was the only word in the English language
that could express his feelings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
“Well!” he said. He looked at the dollar,
and in the tone of a man bewitched he cried,
“Give him the bell, Tommie! You’re off!”</p>

<p>Tommie pulled the strap. “Adoo! Fare
thee well. Good-by. Ready!” he called.
“If we don’t see you again, hello!”</p>

<p>The starter waved his hand. The starter
shook his head.</p>

<p>Car 809 droned merrily along the track until
she came to the first switch. “Give us the
High Bush Line, Jerry,” said James.</p>

<p>The melancholy man jabbed his iron into
the track. High Bush, North Pole, Heaven
or Hades, it was all one to him.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he growled, and they came.</p>

<p>“Hey, there! Hey!” cried an excitable old
gentleman, as the car shot up the side-street
switch. “I thought this car went through
Lethe Street.”</p>

<p>“It used to,” answered Tommie soothingly,
“but it has got weary of it—plumb tired out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
“Tired?” cried the old gentleman blankly.
“Here, let me out!” he concluded with energy.</p>

<p>He stood on the crossing until a brewery-wagon
was driven against him.</p>

<p>“Lunatics—not a doubt of it,” he said to
himself, as he hopped to the sidewalk. There
he waited, but in vain, for no other car would
be sent forth until 809 passed a certain turnout,
which she had not the least intention of
approaching this day.</p>

<p>And that ruptured the schedule.</p>

<p>A sour-faced young man with a fighting jaw
approached the car a few blocks farther on.</p>

<p>“Say! Do youse go through Scrabblegrass
Avenoo?” he asked in a voice like a
curse.</p>

<p>“Now, that depends,” answered the blithe
Thomas. “If we want to, we will; if we
don’t, we won’t. D’yer feel like making it
an object to us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
The sour-faced young man backed up a
step.</p>

<p>“Say, you are a pretty fresh duck, ain’t
you?” he sneered. He quickly put on his
most ferocious look. “Now, you listen to
the toot of my little naughtyobilious horn,”
said he; “and if you don’t I’ll mix you up
with the machinery. I want to go to Scrabblegrass
Avenoo. D’yer get that? The
quicker I get there, the better. D’yer get
that?” He pushed his bulldog jaw into
Thomas’ face.</p>

<p>“Shoo, fly!” said Thomas, making a light
pass with his hand which caused a noisy rustle
in the aftermath that grew upon the other
man’s extensive face.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he continued. “Sure. I get all
these things, of course.” He stopped the car.
He took the fighting-jawed man by the
shoulder and pointed his finger at an angle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
thirty-five degrees to the perpendicular and
at right angles to the car track.</p>

<p>“There is Scrabblegrass Avenoo, right over
yonder,” he said. “Jump!”</p>

<p>Sometimes a fighting jaw merely implies a
fighting character: it doesn’t insist upon it.</p>

<p>“D’yer mean I have got to walk?” asked the
sour-faced man.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said Tommie, “or else you’d
like to have me kick you half-way there?”</p>

<p>“Say, what’s got into you this mornin’?”
gasped the stranger.</p>

<p>It was Tommie’s turn to scoff. He reached
for the strap, smiling derisively.</p>

<p>“You ought to read the papers,” said he;
“then you wouldn’t act like such a lobster.
Things ain’t run like they used to be, my
friend; me and my partner has bought this
car, and we’re running it around, getting custom
where we can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
“Ain’t there no more railroad company?”
said the lost soul confronting him.</p>

<p>“Nope,” answered Tommie with a yawn.
“The hull trolley business is in the hands of
private parties like us—and we’re losing
money on you by the second. Skip!”</p>

<p>From this on, 809 developed more eccentricities
of character. Sometimes she stopped
for passengers like a perfectly normal trolley
car, but if Jimmie did not like the looks of
people as they drew near she bounded ahead
like an antelope, when the foot of habit
was reaching for her step. Then, at a place
of pleasant greenery, refreshing to the city
eye, she often moved up and down the block
several times while her managers enjoyed the
change of scene. This attracted some attention.</p>

<p>They always slowed the car fully to explain
to the out-landers the strange, new conditions
existing in the trolley world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
The passengers made no complaint. It is
so much the custom for the free American to
accept almost anything in uniform as a part
of Nature, and a Nature that grows violent
on provocation, that the half-dozen offspring
of the eagle perched mildly upon their seats
without complaint.</p>

<p>Perhaps they liked it. One stout and jolly
old gentleman enjoyed the discourse immensely,
even joining in the spread of misinformation.</p>

<p>A pallid little woman, with a very large
baby, timidly accosted Jimmie. She wanted
to go to a certain place at least five miles distant,
on a branch line.</p>

<p>Jimmie appealed to the chivalry of the passengers.</p>

<p>“We have got your nickels,” said he, “but
this here lady has been misled. We feel as
if we oughter take her where she belongs.
No objections?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
The passengers looked at each other and
said nothing.</p>

<p>“Let her fly, Jimmie. We have got to
make that five miles in six minutes to keep up
with our idee of things,” said Tommie.</p>

<p>They arrived at the street, but the little
woman’s destination was several blocks from
the trolley track. Jimmie escorted her, carrying
her basket, while the stout old gentleman,
saying that he would like to stretch his
legs, carried the baby.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the car that really belonged
on that track came from the opposite
direction. I will not repeat what that motorman
said. There is a sign on all trolley
cars, “Don’t speak to the motorman.” It is a
good piece of advice, because you might not
like what the motorman would say to you in
reply.</p>

<p>He waved his hands and told 809 to get on
about its business. He wanted to know why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
she was there, in a tone that made the fourth-story
windows fly open.</p>

<p>“What d’yer mean by sitting there like a
toad in a rain-storm, holding us up when
we’re twenty minutes late already?” he finished.</p>

<p>Tommie spread his hands with a gesture of
deprecation.</p>

<p>“Orders,” he replied in explanation. “I
can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Orders?” said the motorman. “Orders?
What are you tin-plated chumps doing in this
part of the country, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Tommie shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It is like this,” said he: “Old Man Rockerfeller
has come to call on an old woman
that used to cook for him, and the company’s
give him the rights of this car—my Mote’s
taking him around to the house now. We’ve
got to wait till he comes back, and you’ve got
to wait, too; that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
The other jumped in the air with astonishment
and fury.</p>

<p>“Well, wouldn’t that knock the frizzles out
of your hair?” said he. “Those old devils
can have anything they want, no matter what
breaks, can’t they?”</p>

<p>“That is just about the size of it, partner,”
said Tommie; “but here comes Jimmie.
We’ll spin back and turn out for you below.”</p>

<p>“Thankee, old man,” said the motorman;
“much obliged; but I can tell you one thing:
I am going to join the Ancient and Honorable
Order of Amalgamated Anarchists this night.
You bet! Call on his cook, and block the
whole line! Well—”</p>

<p>This affair being arranged, 809 grasped the
wire with her trolley, threw off her brakes
and went rushing forward to her fate.</p>

<p>As she sped down Poolton Avenue a party
of young men, with long hair, ran out of a
café, yelling wildly. Tommie pulled the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
“Stop her, Jimmie,” he said. “They look
like our kind of people.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked the panting
youth who arrived first.</p>

<p>“Any old place,” said Tommie. The youth
stopped.</p>

<p>“Hey?” said he.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said Tommie.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the young man, “I only wanted
to know where you went to.”</p>

<p>“Answer same as before,” said Tommie.
“Any old place. We have broke loose from
the tediousness of this darned commercial
life, and we are taking in the United States to
suit ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” earnestly inquired the
young man.</p>

<p>“Try us,” said Tommie. “We’re only a
few.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, all former passengers descended
from the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
“Yours is the route we have been planning,”
said the long-haired young man.</p>

<p>All the young men boarded the car, singing
loudly a song about their dear old something
or other.</p>

<p>Thomas advanced to the front platform,
and 809 gathered herself and hit the irons
per record. She passed would-be passengers
as the City Council passes a bill for more salaries
for faithful services. She was a gallant
sight.</p>

<p>Once when Jimmie went aft to tell a funny
story he had heard the night before, 809 rammed
a street-piano with such insistence and
velocity that it landed on top of a load of
furniture, still playing one of Sousa’s marches.
The Italian burned his thumb in blazing away
at the departing monster with an eighty-nine-cent
revolver. The young men gathered on
the back platform and encouraged him to
shoot with a little more art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Three blocks away, speeding toward them,
there came a red thing, coughing, with inhuman
rapidity. There were four things in
it that looked like Mr. H. G. Wells’ inhabitants
of the moon.</p>

<p>“Here’s where your nice, red, hand-painted
autymobile either takes to its own side of the
road or to the trees!” shouted Jimmie back to
the carload.</p>

<p>The young men swung themselves out to
see the sight. The road was narrow. The
approaching bedevilment, streaming dust at
every pore, bestrode (or, better, bewheeled)
one rail of the track.</p>

<p>“There is your nice little bubble,” chanted
the young men. “‘Bubble, bubble, toil and
trouble!’ Get peevish there, Jimmie! Hit
her on the end!”</p>

<p>Tommie, the mild, called out, “Just one
layer of varnish off will do the trick, Jimmie.”</p>

<p>Naturally, the man at the wheel of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
automobile expected the trolley car to stop.
Had it been an ordinary trolley car, at the
service of mere citizens, it must have stopped,
but being an Independent State of Modern
Progress, it left restraint behind, and could
be seen to move toward that automobile.</p>

<p>“Shove, you shover!” shouted the tallest of
the young men.</p>

<p>It was high time. The side of 809 hit the
rear tire with a rubbery shriek. The red automobile
went over a small knoll of loose stone
and bunch-grass, to the left of the road, and
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>“They can get her back again, all right
enough,” said one of the young men whose
severe face suggested the mechanical engineer.
“Just erect a capstan on top of the hill,
and winch her right back. I don’t know how
far she has gone down the other side. Wish
I had asked you to stop, and put in a bid for
the job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
“Too late,” said Tommie. “There is a
long slant ahead of us, and we’re really going
to run.”</p>

<p>“I could die trolleying!” cooed the stout
young man. “Hit her up in front!” He
clambered over the seats toward the front of
the car.</p>

<p>In the general joy and enthusiasm then
prevailing another young man began to ring
up fares.</p>

<p>“Hey! What yer doin’?” shouted Tommie
in the grip of habit. Then he remembered.
“Let her sizzle,” said he. “No harm
done.”</p>

<p>The register rang. The signal bell rang.
Both gongs rang. It was somewhat like a
party of Swiss bell-ringers tobogganing down
the Matterhorn. Untrained horses walked
upon their hind legs, and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vox populi</i> was
hushed.</p>

<p>The fat young man reached the front platform.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
He was not only fat. He was also
very strong.</p>

<p>“Here, let me run this old shebang?” he
asked Jimmie. “I won’t kill anybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re in the open now,” said Jimmie.
“I guess you can’t do much damage.”
So he gave him the controller and joined the
vocalists.</p>

<p>Minutes passed by to the lilt and swing of
such grand old classics as <i>The Bulldog and
the Bullfrog</i>, and the rest of it, with xylophone
accompaniment, accomplished by
drawing a cane across the rods in the backs of
the seats.</p>

<p>Never had happiness so untrammeled an
occupancy. Number 809 spread her long
wheels in the ecstasy of freedom. Her motors
purred. She passed the high points with
loving pats, scarcely touching them. Her inhabitants
were carried away.</p>

<p>And then, like a handful of mud upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
merriment fell the roar of the man at the controller.
He was grinding frantically at the
brake. The huge muscles of his back had
split his coat in the effort.</p>

<p>The party got up and saw ahead of them a
sharp incline, ending in an unprotected
bridge.</p>

<p>“Gee-rusalem!” bawled Jimmie suddenly.
“Wood’s Bridge—the worst in the country.
I forgot it.”</p>

<p>At that instant a crack, followed by the
jingle of metal, told them that the brake-chain
was broken. The car, which had slacked a
little of its speed, leaped forward again.</p>

<p>“Turn off your power! Reverse, I mean!”
yelled Jimmie.</p>

<p>Then came a thudding sound on the car’s
roof.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he groaned, “the trolley’s off!”</p>

<p>Near that bridge, a few feet from the side
of the track, there was a long haystack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
“Farmers to the front!” said Tommie.
“Every man to the step, and jump!”</p>

<p>In a twinkling twelve young men rolled
along a haystack. They rolled and rolled.
They gathered much hay, but, still dominant
above the mischance, the souls of ten foot-ball
players and two trolley men rose triumphant.
They wanted to see the last of 809.</p>

<p>She took the rest of the grade like a bucking bronco.
She hit the bridge like an avalanche.
Something gave way, or held too
strongly, for 809 sprang into the air, turned
completely over and went down in thirty feet
of dirty water, trucks up, with a tremendous
splash.</p>

<p>Silence stared with stony faces.</p>

<p>“She’s gone,” said Tommie solemnly.</p>

<p>“Beyond recall,” assented the mechanical
engineer.</p>

<p>“And I am going, too,” said Tommie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
The college men said nothing, but, as the
thin procession topped the hill two miles
away, the fat man led by twenty yards.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NUMISMATIST<br />

<span class="subhead">POSSESSION IS NINE POINTS OF THE LAW,
SELF-POSSESSION THE TENTH</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Election</span> day, ’96, was big medicine in
Terrapin. Miners all down from the
upper camps, shoutin’ Free Silver, and morose
about John Sherman. All the cow-boys
from the immediate vicinity were in. The immediate
vicinity of any point in the North-west
is a good big scope of country—say as far
as two men can ride fast in as many days as it
takes to get there.</p>

<p>In Brown’s Bank there was a sound of deviltry
by night. Them back from the bar
couldn’t get back. A damsel with a dulcimer
was dispensin’ sweet strains, and a minority
of the convention thought they was singing to
keep her from feeling conspicuous, each delegate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
voting for a different tune. The toot ongsom
was calculated to make an escaped lunatic
homesick.</p>

<p>In the middle of this dispensation I comes
in, late. I endeavored to attract the attention
of the bar creature by shouting and sign talk,
for I wanted to do my duty. I know I
yelled, for I could feel my jaw waggle, and
my breath give out—but I couldn’t hear nothin’.
No one would take my money. Some
one or two drinks were handed to me, however,
a handful of cigars and six dollars
change. Them Free Silver fellows shore believed
what they said.</p>

<p>So I looked around in search of distraction.
Five deep they stood around the faro and roulette
layouts. Dealers looked like a Turkish
bath from raking in money and shovin’ over
chips. One fellow at the faro table had
more’n six bushel of checks and was betting
with a shovel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
I made for the poker-rooms. Both locked.
I hammers. “Shove your money under the
door,” yells some one inside, “and go away.”</p>

<p>Here was a fine how-de-do. Six months’
wages in my pocket and no action in sight. I
went out in front to hear myself think. On
the porch sat a man, unostentatious, hugging
his knee, observing of the moon.</p>

<p>I shoved a cigar at him. He nods, sticks it
in his face, and hands me up matches over his
shoulder. I likes his looks.</p>

<p>And his sayin’ nothing sounded good, too,
for my ear-drums were jarred clear to my ankles.
I found out later that he wasn’t always
silent. He was a sort of human layer-cake
that way—big slabs of talk and thin streaks of
keeping still.</p>

<p>He didn’t look quite like a cow-boy. Cow-boys’
eyes is all puckered up by sun and wind.
Nor quite like a miner. His hands was white
but they wasn’t tin-horn’s hands, not by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
means. He wasn’t drunk, and I couldn’t understand
him at all, so I felt around.</p>

<p>“Stranger?” says I. He nods.</p>

<p>“Miner?”</p>

<p>“Once.”</p>

<p>“Cow-boy?”</p>

<p>“Once. Everything else—once. Just now
I am a numismatist.”</p>

<p>I set down by him to show that didn’t make
no difference to me.</p>

<p>“Is it—very bad?” I says, kinder solemn
and hushed-like.</p>

<p>“A collector of rare coins,” he explains,
laughing. His laugh was good, too.</p>

<p>“Oh—I see. Got any of them with you?”</p>

<p>“Just one. Be careful of it,” he says, and
hands it to me. I holds it up to the light.
’Twas a common old iron dollar.</p>

<p>“Broke?”</p>

<p>He straightened up indignantly. “Not on
your life—that’s no counterfeit!” he says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
I liked him. I felt friendly. My experience
is that the difference between the friend
that can help you but won’t and the enemy that
would hurt you but can’t isn’t worth notice.
So I dug. When I gave his dollar back I
slid five yellow twenties with it.</p>

<p>He looks ’em over carefully, feeling of
them, edges and both sides, with his finger-tips.
“Very interesting,” he says. “Very
beautiful. How clear the lettering is!” And
he hands ’em back.</p>

<p>“They’re yours, Stranger,” says I. “For
your collection.”</p>

<p>He swells up. “Not much. I’d beg before
I’d accept charity.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand me,” I says, sparring
for time. “I meant as a sporting venture.
I’m superstitious. Men with a wad always
lose it. So why shouldn’t a broke man win?
Take it and win us a home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s different,” says Stranger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
“I accept with pleasure—the more so as I
have an infallible system of winning at roulette,
founded on long observation.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” says I, beginning to feel sorry for
my hundred.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have observed that, if you play
enough, you always lose. You just mathematically
must. The percentage is a scientific
certain-t-y-ty. My system is to bet high,
win, and quit before you begin to lose.”</p>

<p>“How did you ever study it out?” says I,
beginning to be glad about my investment
again. “I never tried that way, but it sounds
promising.”</p>

<p>“Such being the case, I got a hunch,” says
Stranger. “Here goes for a gold chain or a
wooden leg. Take my hand and watch me
peer into the future.”</p>

<p>We wiggled through to the table after a
while. The dealer was a voluptuous swell,
accentuated with solid gold log chains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
ruby rings where convenient. I knew him.
He wore a copyrighted smile losing, and a
nasty sneer when he won. An overbearing
man and opportune, Frenchy, addicted to killing
his fellow-man in sheer self-defense, during
the absence of his assailant’s friends.
Such was his unrefuted statement, the dead
gentlemen having never given their testimony.
He had been so fortunate in his protections
that lots of folks rarely ever went out of their
way to annoy him.</p>

<p>Stranger began hostilities by depositing a
twenty on the black. Red ensued. Another
twenty on black. Black comes. Frenchy
shoved over a ten, and Stranger looked
pained.</p>

<p>“I bet twenty dollars,” he said, lifting of his
brows.</p>

<p>“Ten dollars is the limit for any one bet,”
snaps Frenchy, rolling the ball again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
“Don’t delay the game. Bet or give up your
place.”</p>

<p>“But you took my twenty.” He stopped
the wheel. “No bets this whirl,” says Stranger.</p>

<p>The crowd stopped talking and side-stepped
for an alibi in case the gentleman should
engage in self-defense.</p>

<p>Frenchy bares his teeth and snarls. “You
lost. I got the mon. Why didn’t you inquire?
You orter understand a game before
you buck it. This is my game and my rules
goes. See?”</p>

<p>“I see,” says Stranger quiet. “Give me tens
for these twenties, please.”</p>

<p>Snickers from the crowd. Frenchy had
them Buffaloed to a standstill. All the same,
they had no use for a fellow that let his rights
be trampled on this way. And yet Stranger
didn’t look noways like a man of patient proclivities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
given to turning the other cheek.
Some wise ones cashed their chips when they
remarked his easy smile.</p>

<p>When Frenchy began to roll again we had
the table mostly to ourselves. I moves over
by the wheel to watch the lookout, him having
a game eye and a propensity to be sole witness
for Frenchy when his life was attempted.</p>

<p>“I will now declare myself as for W. J.
Bryan,” says Stranger, dropping ten each on
the squares marked 16, 2, 1.</p>

<p>“Twenty-seven, red, odd and McKinley,”
drones Frenchy, and scoops our thirty.</p>

<p>Stranger strings thirty more on 16, 2, 1.</p>

<p>“Nine, black, odd! Great Republican
gains!”</p>

<p>Frenchy’s singsong was plumb exasperating.</p>

<p>Stranger adorns his three numbers again
with his last thirty, and, as an afterthought,
put his rare old iron dollar on single 0.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
“Single green,” chants Frenchy. “Populist,
by jingo!” I says, as Frenchy rakes the
three tens and pays ’em, with five more to the
green.</p>

<p>Ten each on 16, 2, 1. Then he planks the
six on double green. “I hate a piker!” he
states. And 00 came.</p>

<p>“Alfalfa,” I yells. “Grangers for ever!”</p>

<p>Things was looking up now, but Stranger
was noways concerned. “Six thirty-fives is
two hundred and ten—six I had makes two
sixteen. Hold on till I make a purty.” He
bets ten straight on 16, ten on each corner, ten
on each side. Same play for 2, and a lone ten
on the unit. I never seen a board look so
plumb ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Hope springs infernal in the human
breast. Let ’er go, Hanna!” he says. “A
short life and a merry one!”</p>

<p>The ball spun nearly two weeks. “Sixteen,
black and even,” remarks Frenchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
I takes a swift glance at the wheel then, to
corroborate my ears. “And Bryan,” suggests
Stranger.</p>

<p>“Bryan! Bryan!” yells the crowd.
Miners and cow-boys is Democrats <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>,
and Frenchy’s surreptitious habit of defending
himself was endearin’ Stranger to ’em.
Besides, he was winning. That helps with
crowds.</p>

<p>Paying them bets was complex. We was
over eleven hundred to the good on the turn.
Other business was suspended, and the crowd
lined up, leaving the gladiators the center of
the stage, and a twenty-foot lane so they could
have plenty of air.</p>

<p>“I will now avenge the crime of ’73,” remarks
Stranger. “I’m getting it trained.”
He made the same layout. Strike me dead, if
the ball didn’t jump in a pocket—out—and
back—and out again and deliberated between
2 and 35 while the wheel went around fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
times. You could have heard the split-second
hand on a stop watch in the next county
while it balanced—and at last rope-walked
down in two.</p>

<p>“Two, red, even,” says Frenchy in a shocked
voice, like he was seein’ things at night.</p>

<p>No one could yell—they was a-catching of
their breath. And we lays by twelve hundred
and fifty more.</p>

<p>“Before proceeding further with my witchcraft,”
says Stranger, “I would ask you to set
your valuation of layout, lookout, license and
good-will. Because,” he says, “any fool can
see that the ball stops on the one this time.
Science, poetry, logic, romance, sentiment and
justice point to it, like spokes to a hub. And
if you’re going to bank with that chicken
feed”—jerking his chin toward the shattered
fragments of the bank roll—“you’ll have to
lower your limit ... before I play.
Oh, I’m learning fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Frenchy looks unhappy, but there wasn’t
nothing to say. His pile wasn’t big enough
to pay if Stranger’s predictions was accurate.
“Bring me my sack, Brown,” he calls out.
Brown opens his safe and lugs over the sack.
Frenchy pours it out on the table—ten thousand
dollars, bills of all sizes from five to a
thousand, and a coffee-pot full of gold.
“Shoot,” he says. “You’re faded.”</p>

<p>Stranger eclipses the one spot with ten dollar
bills: ten each on corners, the four sides
and the middle. “It’s a sure thing—we’d just
as well have some side money,” he says, betting
ten each on black, odd, first column, first
dozen and 1 to 18. “Mr. Brown,” he says,
“the gentleman who runs the game will hand
you seventy dollars when the ball stops.
Drinks for the crowd while it lasts,” and drops
ten each on 16 and 2, for luck.</p>

<p>Buz-z-z. The ball hums a cheerful ditty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
like hot coffee on a cold day. Buz-z-z—Click.</p>

<p>Frenchy goes into a trance, chewing his
mouth. He moistens his lips and makes an
effort. “One, black, and odd!” His voice
was cracked and horrified.</p>

<p>“What a pleasant dream!” I thinks. “It’s
a shame to wake up and wrangle horses, but
it must be near day.” I tries to open my eyes,
but couldn’t. ’Twas no dream of avarice.
Stranger was just visible above a pyramid of
deferred dividends.</p>

<p>“Great Democratic gains,” he announces.
“Gentlemen—in fact, all of you—what’ll you
have?”</p>

<p>“I guess that includes me, all right,” states
a big miner. “Strictly speaking, I don’t want
no drink now, but, if you’d just as soon tell
me what color my old pack-mare’s next colt’ll
be, I sh’d be obliged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
No one wanted a drink—nobody moved.
More miracles was what they wanted.
“What? No drinks?” says Stranger. “Prohibition
landslide in Terrapin? Can I believe
my ears—or my nose? Well, then, I
will pursue my hellish purpose. I appeal to
the calm judgment of this crowd, if they ever
heard of an election without repeaters?” But
he doesn’t let his gaze wander to the crowd
none whatever. He never taken both eyes off
Frenchy to oncet, since the limit had been
pulled on him.</p>

<p>He decorated the board just as it was the
last time, and looks on with pleased expectancy
while the ball spins. I hope I may be
saved it it didn’t come a repeater!</p>

<p>Stranger yawns as he pulls in thirteen hundred
and twenty dollars. “Thanking you for
your kind attention,” he states, “the entertainment
is now concluded. Will some one trust
me for a sack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
“Feet cold?” sneers Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I’m quite comfortable. But I
<em>might</em> lose if I kept on,” Stranger explains.
“Those numbers may not come again for ever
so long. This is a piking game, anyhow. I
like to bet my money in large chunks.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be a sort of a Democrat,” suggests
Frenchy. “Why not back up your
views? Here’s seven thousand says McKinley’s
elected.”</p>

<p>“Why, <em>that’s</em> my game,” says Stranger,
beaming. “That’s just what I wanted.
Bryan’s going to sweep the country from Dan
to Milwaukee.”</p>

<p>I gives him the nudge, for I sees our pile
a-glimmering. I don’t mind betting on cards
or horses and such, but politics is tricky. But
he prattles on, plumb carried away by the
courage of his convictions.</p>

<p>Frenchy’s nose dented. Why, I learned
later, but I’ll tell you now. Terrapin was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
sixty miles from a telegraph office and all
right-minded citizens was here present. But
this sure-thing sport, knowing we was all for
Bryan, had posted a relay on the North trail
to bring him news. It was now way past midnight.
He had known McKinley was in since
about the time I was staking Stranger, and
poor, innocent, confiding Stranger walks right
into his trap.</p>

<p>“Even money?” asks Frenchy.</p>

<p>“I would shorely scorn to take such an
advantage of you,” says Stranger. “I’ll give
you a chance for your white alley. I will
now proceed to divide my capital into five
parts. The first part contains fifteen hundred
dollars, which I bet you against five hundred
dollars that Bryan is our next President. I
will then bet you fifteen hundred even that
Bryan carries thirty-six states, a list of which
I will make out and seal. Third pile, two
thousand dollars, gives you a chance to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
even if you’re lucky. Give me odds of five to
one and I bet this two thousand that Bryan
carries four other states, names of which will
also be deposited under seal with stake-holder.
Pile number four, five hundred dollars, goes
even that I made a good bet. Number five,
one hundred and sixty-six dollars, goes in my
pocket for tobacco and postage stamps and
other luxuries.”</p>

<p>“You’re delirious. Your money’s a gift,”
says Frenchy. “Make out your agreements.
It’ll take more’n I got to cover that five to one
bet, but I can borrow the Northern Pacific on
that proposition.” He takes Brown off for a
confidential and comes back with the money
by the time Stranger had the bet in writing
and signed.</p>

<p>Frenchy reads it aloud. “You are all witnesses,”
he says, and slaps his fist to it.
“Name your stake-holder.”</p>

<p>“Put it in Mr. Brown’s safe—money, agreement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
and my two lists of states. Decide to-morrow
at five <span class="smcap smaller">P. M.</span> when the stage comes in.”</p>

<p>They makes a bundle of it and locks it up.
“And now,” says Stranger to me, “my presentiments
points for bed.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you quit when I wanted you
to, you ijit?” I says. “You made the worst
break I ever see.”</p>

<p>“You certainly surprise me. Haven’t I
raised you to a position of opulence by my
acumen and foresight? Your ingratitude
grieves me to my heart’s core—and just when
we stand to more than double our money, too.”</p>

<p>“Acumen! Foresight!” I jeers. “’Twas
blind, bulldog, damn-fool luck. I furnished
all the judgment used when I tried to stop you.
I put up the money, and you had a right to
harken to me.”</p>

<p>“You’re my partner,” says he calmly.
“Half this money is yours, and all, if you need
it. But I lost <em>your</em> money. This here is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
proceeds of my iron dollar. By to-morrow
night we’ll have eleven thousand, anyway, and
here you’re complaining. I do hate a quitter.”</p>

<p>“And I hate a fool. You have a chance to
win one bet, and that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’ll regret this hasty speech to-morrow
night. Follow me, and you’ll wear diamonds!”</p>

<p>“Yes—on the seat of my pants,” I rejoins
bitterly. And all them somewhat diverse
prophecies came to pass.</p>

<p>When we woke, after noon, ’twas pretty
well known how the election went, and we was
guyed unmerciful.</p>

<p>But Stranger wasn’t noways dejected. “Rumor—mere
rumor. ‘Out of the nettle danger
we may pluck the flower safety,’” he spouts,
waving his hands like a windmill. “I’ve
been in worse emergencies, and always
emerged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
I was considerable sore and was for not
showing up to turn over the money, but he
persuaded me.</p>

<p>“At the worst Frenchy owes me ten that I
won fair on the second bet last night,” he says.
“If I have to collect that, I aim to charge him
something for collectin’. I had that in mind
last night if the green hadn’t come when my
dollar was on it.”</p>

<p>I sees reason in this, and oils my guns.</p>

<p>Frenchy was waitin’ with his lookout, gay
and cheerful. “Did you bring your sack?”
was his greeting.</p>

<p>“Why, no, I forgot. Hi! Bud!” Stranger
gives a boy five dollars. “Bring an ore sack
to the barkeep for me, and keep the change.”</p>

<p>We gets Brown with the package of stake
money and prognostications on our way
through the crowd to a back room. Brown
busts the package and begins the hollow
mockery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
“Bet number one.” He reads the specifications.
“Bryan loses. Any objections?”</p>

<p>Stranger shakes his head sorrowful, and
pushes over the two-thousand-dollar packet.</p>

<p>“Bet number two.” Brown breaks the list
of thirty-six states. “For Bryan,” he reads:
“Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Minnesota—” His feelings overcome
him and he laughs till the tears roll
down his face. Frenchy leers, and the lookout
rocks himself back and forward. And to
cap it off comes a knock, and barkeep comes in
with the sack Stranger ordered.</p>

<p>They howled. “I’ll give you ten for your
sack,” gasps Frenchy.</p>

<p>“You needn’t rub it in,” says Stranger, injured.
“I certain was mistook in them estimates.
Pass on to the next.”</p>

<p>“Third bet,” wheezes Brown. He wipes
his cheeks and tears open the list of four
states. “Bryan will carry—” he begins. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
turns pale, his tongue stuck to the roof of
his mouth, and his eyes bugged out so you
could hang your hat on ’em.</p>

<p>“<em class="smcap">Texas!</em>” he screeches. “<em>Arkansas, Georgia</em>,
<em class="smcap">South Carolina</em>!”</p>

<p>“<em>Then</em> I made a good bet!” observes
Stranger, popping the rest of the money into
the sack.</p>

<p>“What!” yells Frenchy. “You were to
name four additional states—forty in all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Four <em>others</em>. These four were
not in my list of thirty-six. You lost and
I’ve got the mon. Why didn’t you inquire?
You orter understand a game before you play
it. This is my game, and my rules go. See?”</p>

<p>Stranger’s gun was dangling on his right
hip, but, as Frenchy drew, Stranger’s right
hand caught his’n, gun and all, and Stranger’s
left produced a .45 from nowhere at all and
proceeds to bend it over Frenchy’s head. The
tin-horn couldn’t get his right hand loose, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
he reaches around with his left, jerks Stranger’s
gun from his hip. But he only wastes
time snapping it, for that one wasn’t loaded.</p>

<p>I thought maybe Brown and the lookout
would double up on my pardner, but they
didn’t. They just shoved the two pits of their
two stomachs up against the muzzles of my
two guns, and looked foolish.</p>

<p>“Nuff!” screams Frenchy, letting go his
gun. He looks like ration day at Rosebud.
Me and Stranger walks out, sticking closer’n
brothers, lockstepping, back to back.</p>

<p>“What’d I tell you?” says Stranger, turning
in at a butcher shop. And there he asks may
we use the scales, and pours our ill-gotten
gains into both scoops till they balance.
“Take your choice, pardner,” he says.
“You’re short on faith, but you’re hell on
works!”</p>

<p>Next to a restaurant. Before our order
comes, in steps Billy Edwards. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
deputy sheriff, but white. “Would you mind
my asking your name? ’Cause Frenchy
doesn’t know. He’s swearing out a warrant
for you, alleging assault with intent to kill,”
says Billy politely. “They haven’t give me
the warrant yet. Course if they had I wouldn’t
tell you this, for you might get away before
I found you.”</p>

<p>I’d never thought to ask his name!</p>

<p>“Artemus G. Jones,” says he, and he stuck
his thumb in his vest. “Set down and take
supper with us.”</p>

<p>“Ar—ahem. Er—what does the G. stand
for?”</p>

<p>Artie looks embarrassed. “Galatians,” he
sighs.</p>

<p>“What? Was you named after—”</p>

<p>“I was named,” says Artie, “after a family
scrap. Can’t you suppress it? Artemus G.
ought to identify me.”</p>

  <div class="caption">Frenchy told a terrible tale of wanton robbery. <span class="in1"><a href="#Page_57">Page 57</a></span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
“I—I thought it might spell easier,” says
Billy.</p>

<p>After supper we walks over and gets the
warrant. Billy arrests Artie and disarms
him. “<em>You</em> know <em>your</em> business—I’ll make
any kind of bet on that,” says Billy; “but in
your place I should have been far away on a
bounding bronco.”</p>

<p>We went to be tried before Judge Eliot.
Frenchy kept a jack-leg lawyer named Satterlee,
and he was helping persecute.</p>

<p>“Have you legal advice, prisoner?” says his
Honor.</p>

<p>“A little,” says Artie softly.</p>

<p>“Proceed. Call the plaintiff.”</p>

<p>Frenchy took the stand and told a terrible
tale of wanton robbery and brutal, unprovoked
violence. He had won an election bet
from prisoner, and prisoner had taken the
money by force. He showed his wounds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
He shore looked like he’d been playing goat
with a buzz-saw.</p>

<p>Brown and the lookout was good witnesses,
but they let out, when the Judge questioned
them, that Artie had the money in his sack before
the trouble began and that Frenchy had
a gun. And not a word about my presence
of mind.</p>

<p>Artie allowed he wouldn’t cross-examine
them. His Honor was riled. “Will you
take the stand, sir?” he says.</p>

<p>Artie stretches. “Oh, no—I guess it’s not
worth while to take up your time. Ugh—o—oaoh,”
he says, yawning.</p>

<p>Judge was furious. “Prisoner, if you’ve
got any witnesses in your defense, call ’em.
As the evidence stands—up you go!”</p>

<p>Artie placed himself on top of his feet.
“Your Honor,” he says “call Billy Edwards.”</p>

<p>Billy gives his name, sex, color, and other
essentials. Then says Artie:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
“You arrested me to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was my gun loaded?”</p>

<p>“One of them was empty. The other one
had five cartridges in it,” Edwards promptly
asserts.</p>

<p>“Was the loaded one bloody?”</p>

<p>“Awful.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” says Artie with a gracious
wave of his hand, dismissing the witness.
“Your Honor, our friend the Gaul, alias
Frenchy, is before you. I am refined by nature.
One gentle pull on the trigger would
have removed all doubt. He would have
been dead dead. He isn’t. I move that my
client, Artemus G. Jones, me, I, myself, be
discharged, and plaintiff reprimanded for
frivolity in taking up the time of the court.
Had I wished to kill this jigger I certainly
would have shot him. The gun that was
bloody was the gun of Artemus,” and Artie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
paid the whole blamed court a compliment
by the way he retired.</p>

<p>Frenchy’s lawyer began to holler, but the
judge cut him quick. “Sit down, Mr. Satterlee,”
says he. “Unless you can prove your
client is dead, the court will pursue the course
indicated by the learned counsel for defense.”</p>

<p>“Selah!” says Satterlee. “I’m down. Set
’em up in the other alley.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MASCOT OF THE GRAYS<br />

<span class="subhead">A BASE-BALL GAME AND THE SUBSEQUENT
PROCEEDINGS</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“Why</span>, yes!” said Mr. Perkins, “I’ll tell
you all about it, if you’ve got the
time to spare. I was managing the Grays—that
was the club from the west side of the
river, you know—and we thought ourselves
the prettiest things that ever played base-ball
in Dakota; for a while. And then we had
hard luck. Our fancy pitcher was an ex-soldier
named Fitzeben; a well-built, pale, handsome
fellow, with lots of style, and no heart.
As long as things were coming his way, he
could put up a game of base-ball that would
make a man forget his religion; but if they began
to find him on the other side, Fitz would
go to slops on the run. First-base was this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Falk you was speaking about. There was a
Hoodoo playing second. ‘Hindoo?’ Yes,
that’s it. You’ve got it. He’d come a long
ways to our town. Nice, pleasant little man
he was, too, with a name that would have
made him an overcoat and a pair of pants, and
then something left for the babies—‘Dammerjoodeljubberjubberchah,’
or words to that
effect. The boys called him ‘Jub,’ so it didn’t
matter so much about that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins stopped to crook his elbow,
as they say in the vernacular, and stood a while
in silence, as the tears of ecstasy gathered in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Whoo, Jimmy!” said he, “there ought to
go a damper with that whisky—it’s almost
<em>too</em> good with the full draft on. Blast
your seltzer! Give me water. I like my
whisky and my water straight, just as God
made ’em. Well, I was telling you about
our outfit. One of our fellows was crooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
as a ram’s horn—Jim Burke, that played
short. Darn his buttons! He couldn’t keep
his hands off other people’s property to save
his neck. And gall!—say, that man was
nothing but one big gall with a thin wrapper
of meat around it. One day old Solomon,
that had the clothing store, comes to
me oozing trouble.</p>

<p>“‘Misder Berkints,’ says he, ‘dere ain’t
nubuddy vich dakes more pleasure in der
pall-blaying as I do. If you vant ten tollar
or dwenty tollar vor der club, vy, dake id!
dake id! I gif it midout some vords, but I
ain’t going to stand such monkey-doodle peesnesses.’</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter now, Sol?’</p>

<p>“‘Vot ees der madder? I tell you vat ees
der madder. Dot feller Burke, he goom by
der store, unt he valk off mid a case. A case!
Mein Gott! A whole case of zusbenders,
und gollar-puttons, unt so fort! I find him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
in Gurley’s blace, puddin’ it oop vor der
drinks. I don’t vant to sboil der pall-blaying,
bud dot feller ort to bin in chail.’</p>

<p>“I went with him, and we hunted brother
Burke up. I read him the riot act, but he
was brassy.</p>

<p>“‘Why, he give me the case!’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Gif you der case!’ yells old Solomon, ‘I!
Vich ees me? Dis shentleman right here?’
tapping himself on the chest. ‘I gif you dot
case? Gott! Mein frendt! You talk like
a sausage!”</p>

<p>“There was no use of my trying to keep
my face straight. Talking like a sausage hit
me on the funny-bone, and I had to holler.</p>

<p>“But as soon as I could get my face shut,
I went for Burke bald-headed. I told him
I’d knock fourteen different styles of doctrine
in him if he didn’t behave better.</p>

<p>“There’s where that big stiff Falk and I
came together for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“‘What have you got to do with it?’ says
he. ‘No harm done if he cleaned the d——d
Jew out entirely.’ Well, now mostly I hate
a Jew as well as the next man, but old Sol was
a free spender. He’d put up for anything
that was going, and, Jew or no Jew, it made
me hot to hear Falk talk like that. More
especially as his tone wasn’t any too pleasant.</p>

<p>“‘Who the devil are you talking to,’ says
I, ‘me, or the hired man? I want you to
understand I’m running this thing, pardner!’</p>

<p>“‘Little chance anybody has to forget it,’
he says with a big jarring laugh. Don’t you
know that dirty, sneering laugh he had?</p>

<p>“Well, I was some warm. First off, I
thought I would walk away and not make any
trouble; then I thought to myself, ‘Here, I
fought Jack Dempsey sixteen rounds the last
time I appeared in the ring, and I reckon I’m
not going to let any big swaggering stiff of a
Dutchman get away with any such a crack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
as that!’ Those fellers didn’t know about
my being a profesh. I changed my name
when I quit, after Dempsey licked me, and I
never was much of a hand to talk.</p>

<p>“So without any words, I drove a right-hander
into Mr. Falk’s Adam’s apple. You’ll
hear this and that place spoken of as a tender
spot, but when you want to settle a man quick
and thorough, jam him in the Adam’s apple.
Falk must have weighed a hundred pounds
more than I did, but he went down like a
load of bricks. I wasn’t taking any chances
with such odds in weight against me. To
be sure, I had the science, but the only science
I ever saw that was worth a cuss in a street
fight is to hit the other man early and often,
and with all the enthusiasm you can bring
to bear. Falk laid on his back, very thoughtful,
wondering where he was going to get
his next breath of air from. A crack in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Adam’s apple does a good many things at the
same time: It stops your wind; gives you a
pain in the head; a ringing in your ears; a
cramp in the stomach, and a looseness in the
joints, all at once. I realized that Mr. Falk
wouldn’t be in condition to do business for
some time, and as I was right in the spirit of
the thing, now that I’d got started, I thought
I might as well head Burke up, too.</p>

<p>“I cut him on the end of his Irish nose, and
stood it up in the air like the stack of an old
wood-burner. Then I whaled him in the
butt of the jaw for keeps.</p>

<p>“He fell all over Solomon, and down they
went together.</p>

<p>“‘Don’d you mindt me, Mr. Berkints,’ says
old Sol, as he scrambled after his hat; ‘Id’s
all righd. Dot’s for der zusbenders; gif him
a vew vor der gollar-puttons.’ He was a
funny motzer, that Solomon. It broke me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
up so the fight all went out of me. But I
up-ended Burke and gave him a medicine
talk.</p>

<p>“I’ve been too easy with you fellers, and
I see it,’ says I. ‘From this on, however,
there won’t be any complaint on that score.
You’ll feel like a lost heathen god in the wilderness,
if you try any more playing horse
with me; I think that blasted stubborn
Dutchman is beyond reason—perhaps I’ll
have to really hurt him yet—but I think
there’s reason in <em>you</em>, and you’d better use it,
unless you want me to spread you all over
the fair face of nature.’</p>

<p>“You see, the citizens of the town had been
liberal in coming through for the ball team,
and naturally they took the greatest pride in
it. We were like soldiers going out to fight.
Every time we went away from home to play,
the town saw us off with the band, and welcomed
us back with the same—winner or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
loser. Now, I was the manager, and of
course, everybody looked to me to see that
things were run right; consequently, when
fellers cut up like Burke and Falk, it wasn’t
to be stood.</p>

<p>“Well, Burke said he’d give the matter his
careful consideration.</p>

<p>“‘All right, see that you do,’ says I. ‘Now
screw your nut home, and put your face in a
sling till you look better. We don’t want any
such picture of hard times as you are on the
ball field.’</p>

<p>“When Falk got so he could understand
language, I gave him a few passages of the
strongest conversation I had on tap.</p>

<p>“He listened, to be sure, and didn’t give me
any slack; but it was a sullen kind of listening—just
that he was afraid to do different,
that’s all.</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you that these two fellers
was really hired to play ball. The superintendent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
of the division gave them a job in
the shops, and we paid ’em extra. Falk, he
was a painter; and I wish you could see the
blue, green and yaller ruin he made of a
passenger car. The boss painter wasn’t onto
the game, and took the supe’s talk in earnest,
therefore he starts Falk out single-handed to
paint the car. The boss painter was a quiet
man usually, but when he saw that work of
art, he let go of some expressions that would
have done credit to a steamboat rooster.
More, he heaved a can of red paint on
brother Falk, and swore he’d kill him too
dead to skin, if he dared put foot in the shop
again. This boss painter was a sandy little
man, even if he wasn’t as big as a pint of cider,
and had been leaded so many times that he
shook like a quaking asp. The supe had to
argue with him loud and long before he’d
hear of Falk’s coming back.</p>

<p>“Burke went into the round-house, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
all the fellers were more or less sports, and
understood the play.</p>

<p>“Not square to hire ’em? Well, it wasn’t
exactly, but the crowd across the river taught
us the game—they did it first.</p>

<p>“Well, now I’ll tell you how we came by
the Injun—the mascot. He was an old feller—the
Lord only knows how old—who used
to hang around the station selling Injun trinkets
to the passengers. He had a stick with
notches cut into it to tell how old he was, but
the boys used to get the stick and cut more
notches when his nibs wasn’t looking, until
Methusalom was a suckling kid alongside of
that record. ‘Me so old—huh,’ the Injun
used to say, and hand the stick to the passengers.
They’d be full of interest until they
counted up to four or five hundred, when
they would smile in a sickly way, and go
about their business, feeling that they had
been taken in shameful, and much regretting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the quarter, or whatever chicken-feed it was
they contributed to old Bloody-Ripping-Thunder’s
support. No, ‘Bloody-Ripping-Thunder’
probably wasn’t his name; but
that’s what young Solomon christened him.</p>

<p>“Young Solomon was nephew to the old
feller, and his pardner in the clothing store.
He was a great sport. A darned decent
young lad. It was his idea that we needed
a mascot. We sure did need something about
that time, for if there was anything in Dakota
that hadn’t beaten us, it was only because they
didn’t know our address.</p>

<p>“Ike Solomon takes Rip—that’s short for
the aforesaid Injun—into his store one day,
a bent, white-haired old man, clad in a dirty
blanket, moccasins, and a hat that looked as
if it had come off the rag heap, and he works
a miracle with him. He wouldn’t let nary
one of us inside until he’d carried out his
plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
“When we did go in, there stood as spruce
a young gent of a hundred or so as ever you
see. That Injun had on a cheap but decent
light hand-me-down suit, b’iled shirt and
paper collar, red necktie, canvas shoes—mighty
small they were; he had feet like a
lady—pocket-handkercher with red border
sticking out of his pocket, cane in his hand,
a white plug hat on his head and a pair of
specs on his nose. We were simply dumfounded;
that’s the only word for it. The
old cuss carried himself pretty well. Darned
if you’d find a white man of his years that had
as much style to him. And proud! Well,
that don’t give you any idea of it. He
strutted around like a squint-eyed girl that’s
just hooked a feller.</p>

<p>“When he started off down the street to
give the folks a benefit, we had our laugh out.</p>

<p>“Into every store of the place goes Mr.
Rip. Walks up and down and says ‘Huh!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
After he thinks the folks have had a fair show
to take in his glory, ‘Huh!’ says he again,
and tries next door. The whole town was
worked up over it. The fellers would shake
him by the hand, bowing and scraping and
giving him all sorts of steers.</p>

<p>“Well, we had our mascot now, so there
was no particular reason why we shouldn’t
try to get somebody’s scalp.</p>

<p>“We sent a challenge to the Maroons, which
they accepted, too quick. The game was to
be played on our grounds, and with the eyes
of our friends on us, you bet we meant to do
our little best; but luck was against us. Our
second base, the Hoodoo, had got snake bit.
Rattler struck him in the right hand. He
had a mighty close squeak for his life. The
right field, Doctor Andis, the nicest gentleman
that ever wore shoes, was coming down
with the fever that carried him off.</p>

<p>“To crown all, just when I should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
been rustling around the liveliest, I had one
of my headaches—the worst I ever had.
Lord! For three days I couldn’t see, and
then a fool of a man told me whisky was
good for it, and I took his advice. When
the drink started my heart up, darned if I
didn’t think the top of my head was coming
off. I ought to have been in bed the day
of the game, but of course that wasn’t to be
thought of.</p>

<p>“Well, the boys were nervous, and I was
sick, and though I tried my best to put a
good foot forward, I’m afraid I didn’t help
matters any.</p>

<p>“Everybody and his grandmother turned
out. The town knocked off business altogether.
The weather was fine for ball,
with this exception, the wind blew strong up-field.
That was dead against <em>us</em>, though it
helped their pitcher mightily, as he was weak
on curves, and pitching into the wind added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
at least a foot to his range. With our man,
Fitzeben, it was different; he had a tremendous
knack on curves; blamed if he couldn’t
almost send a ball around a tree, and the
extra twist threw him off his reckoning so
badly that he lost all command of the ball,
and finally got so rattled that we had to put
another man in, in the fifth inning. They
were slaughtering us then—the score was fifteen
to two. We picked up a little after
that, and in the ninth it looked as if we might
tie them, if we had barrels of good luck.</p>

<p>“Falk went to bat. I cautioned him to
wait for his chance; but you know what a
grand-stand player he was; he had the gallery
in his eye all the time. He was a big,
fine looking feller, in a way, but stuck on
his shape beyond all reason; so, instead of taking
it easy, he swipes at everything that came,
keeping up a running fire of brag all the
time that made everybody very tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
“Just before the last ball crossed the plate,
he gave the folks to understand that he was
going to belt the cover off it, and the remains
would land down by the river. He
made a fierce pass at it; missed it a mile,
caught his toe and waltzed off on his ear.
He got a dirty fall and everybody was glad of
it. We all laughed ‘Haw! Haw!’ just as
loud as we could. Falk got up, boiling mad.
He looked at us as if he’d like to eat us raw;
but there wasn’t any one round there he felt
safe to make trouble with, until his eyes fell
on old Ripping-Thunder, sitting up straight
in his new clothes and specs and plug hat
and cane, and laughing as fine as anybody.
Then that big Dutchman did the cowardliest
thing I ever saw; he walks up and smashes
poor Rip in the face, just as hard as he could
drive. ‘Now laugh! you d—d Injun!’ says
he. There was a riot in a minute, and I
had to keep the fellers off of Falk, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the Lord knows my mind was different! The
other captain refused to play the game out.
He didn’t want any truck with such people,
he said, and, while our boys were crying hot,
we couldn’t do a thing but let ’em go.</p>

<p>“I picked up old Rip and asked him if
he was hurt. He tried to smile—although
his mouth looked like an accident to a balloon,
where that big lubber hit him—and told me
no, not hurt.</p>

<p>“But his eyes were on Falk all the time,
following every move he made. I tell you
what, my son, never you hit an Injun unawares.
No matter how old or helpless he
may seem, it ain’t safe. An Injun’s not out
of it till he’s dead, and then it’s just as well
to be careful. I know one buck that lashed
the trigger of his rifle to his arm with his
dying hands, and blew a hole like a railroad
tunnel through the feller that tried to take
his gun away from him, as well as changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the appearance of the next man behind, which
was me; you can see the mark running back
from my eyebrow. I’ll tell you about that
skirmish sometime. It was the liveliest I
ever got into. Well, the Injun’s eyes were
a little bleary from age before, but they were
bright enough now. I know I thought it
won’t be well for you, brother Falk, if the
old man gets a crack at you; but being so
disgusted with the way things come out, and
sick besides, I didn’t pay much attention.</p>

<p>“The next day was prairie-chicken day.
Fifteenth of August the law’s up, ain’t it?
I can remember the day all right, but I’m
never quite sure of the date—and all of the
fellers turned out in force to reduce the visible
supply of chicken; me and my friend
Stevens among the rest. We got a later start
than most of the boys, and it must have been
ten or after before we reached McMillan’s
flat, where we were going to do our shooting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
We drove around here and there, but
we never flushed a feather.</p>

<p>“‘Now, Jay,’ says Stevens, ‘let’s cut for old
man Simon’s shack; there is likely to be some
birds in his wheat stubble.’ So off we went.
We were sailing down the little sharp coulée
which opens on Simon bottom when we
heard a gun-shot to the right, and not far off.</p>

<p>“‘Hello!’ says Stevens, ‘there’s a fellow in
luck; we’ll give him a lift if he’s got more
than he can handle.’</p>

<p>“‘Sounded more like a rifle to me, Steve,’
says I.</p>

<p>“‘Well, let’s investigate anyhow—what the
blazes is that?’ For just then riz up a wild
howl, ‘Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!’ it says.</p>

<p>“‘I could swear that that was the voice of
that sweet gentleman, Mr. Falk,’ says I. ‘Tie
up, and we’ll creep to the top of the bank
and see what’s going on; if Falk’s in trouble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
I wouldn’t miss it for anything.’ We made
our sneak and looked down. Beneath us was a
sort of big pot-hole, say forty foot across.
On one side was brother Falk, his face as
serious as though he was playing a rubber
with the gent that always wins, but stepping
it high, wide, and frolicsome. Gee! what
pigeon wings and didoes he cut! And the
reason of it sat on the other side of the pot-hole
watching him—Brother Ripping-Thunder,
with a rifle in his hand, enjoying himself
much, and smiling as good as the damaged
condition of his mouth would allow.</p>

<p>“‘Hunh!’ says he, ‘that’s plenty dance—now
stand on head.’</p>

<p>“‘I can’t!’ says Falk, ‘I don’t know how!’</p>

<p>“‘Learn!’ says the Injun, ‘now good time.’</p>

<p>“Falk started to make some objections, but
old Rip raised the rifle, and Falk, with a
wild, despairing cuss, up-ended himself. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
was a big man, as I’ve told you, and when he
keeled over he come down so hard it jarred
the earth.</p>

<p>“‘Wakstashonee!’ cries Rip, ‘that worst I
ever see! Got to do better, or I shoot anyhow!’</p>

<p>“So up goes Falk, and down he comes, and
up he goes and down he comes, in all kinds
of shapes and styles till Steve and me, we
had to jam our handkerchers in our mouths
for fear we’d snort out loud and spoil the
game.</p>

<p>“‘Holy sufferin’!’ says Steve, ‘but ain’t he
just everlastingly run up against the worst of
it this heat! We couldn’t have wished no
better if we tried, Jay!’</p>

<p>“Well, I should say that there wasn’t a
piece as big as a quarter on Falk that wasn’t
black and blue when at last he seemed to get
the knack of it, and held himself up in a
wobbly sort of way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
“‘There,’ says Rip, ‘that’s more like business.
Just keep feet still—I going to shoot
heels off boots.’</p>

<p>“Falk hollered murder.</p>

<p>“Old Rip shook his head. ‘You make such
noise I get rattled and shoot hole through
foot,’ he complained. Falk shut up like a
clam.</p>

<p>“‘Here we go fresh!’ says Rip. ‘Now
don’t move feet.’</p>

<p>“Blam! And the right heel zipped into
space. Blim! And away went the left one.</p>

<p>“‘Good shooting for old man!’ says Rip.
‘Now you rest. Bimeby we have some more
fun.’</p>

<p>“You should have seen Falk’s face as he sat
there resting, with the pleasant future in his
mind. He wasn’t happy, and he showed it.
As soon as he got his wind he tried to bribe
Rip, but it didn’t go. He promised him
money and ponies and whisky and tobacco,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and everything under the sun. Rip simply
shook his head. ‘Don’t want!’ says he.
‘Having plenty good time now. Don’t talk
any more. Want think what do next.’</p>

<p>“So there they sat, and whenever Rip
looked at a place, Falk, he looked too, for
he had a large interest in the matter, and it
was pretty medium hard to figure out what
was passing through Rip’s head.</p>

<p>“There was a mud-puddle with about six
inches of water and six foot of mud at the
end of the pot-hole. Rip took that in very
earnest.</p>

<p>“‘Hunh,’ says he, ‘you rested now!’</p>

<p>“‘No, I ain’t!’ cries Falk, with the sweat
starting out all over him. ‘I ain’t rested a
little bit. Now, just wait a minute—honest,
I’m all played out!’</p>

<p>“‘No ask question—tell you about it. I
say rested, you <em>rested</em>,’ answers Rip, in a tone
of voice that wasn’t to be argued with. Falk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
knuckled. ‘For God’s sake! What’s it going
to be now?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“‘You <em>fish</em>,’ says Rip. ‘Plenty dam big fat
fish, you!’ He pointed to the puddle. ‘Now
swim!’</p>

<p>“I may have mentioned that Falk was stuck
on his appearance? Well, he was—powerful.
So when it came to wallowing around
in a mud-puddle with his brand new hunting
clothes on, he beefed for fair. Moses!
How he cussed!</p>

<p>“Then old Rip raised the rifle again, and
there was a bad light in his old eyes. I
can’t give you no idea of the satisfaction he
expressed as he simply repeated the one word,
‘swim!’</p>

<p>“Brother Falk ground his teeth till the slivers
flew; Rip moved his forefinger. That
was enough. Into the mud, ker-sock! goes
Falk, and the slime splashed a rod around.</p>

<p>“All this time the Injun had been sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
quiet and sneering, but now he entered into
the spirit of the thing. He capered like a
school-boy. ‘Leelah ouashtay!’ He hollered.
‘Swim, fish! Kick, fat fish! Kick!
Make hand go! Make head go! Make
foot go! Wyupee! Chantay meatow leelah
ouashtayda!’ Then he took to spanking Falk
with the butt of the rifle. It was ‘a animated
scene,’ as the poet says. You don’t often get
a chance to see a two-hundred-and-twenty
pound bully lying on his stomach in a mud-puddle
swimming for dear life, so Steve and
me made the most of it.</p>

<p>“There was Falk hooking mud like a raving
maniac—fountains and geysers and waterspouts
of mud—while Rip pranced around
him, war-whooping and yelling, and laying
it on to him with the rifle-butt until each
crack sounded like a pistol-shot. It seldom
falls to the lot of man or boy to get such a
thorough, heartfelt, soul-searching spanking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
as that ugly Dutchman received. My! I
could feel every swat clear down to my toes,
and there isn’t a shadow of doubt in my mind
that Falk did too.</p>

<p>“And that Injun looked so comical flying
around in his high hat and specs and new
clothes and canvas shoes! It was a sight to
make a horse laugh. By and by Steve
couldn’t stand it and he roared right out.
That stopped the matinée. Rip looked up at
us and grinned. ‘I got openers, this pot,’ says
he, tapping the rifle. ‘Play nice game with
friend—stand up, big, fat fish.’</p>

<p>“Well, we had a conniption fit when Falk
made himself perpendicular. He <em>was</em> a
sight! If there ever a man lived whose name
ought to be Mud, ’twas Falk. His hair was
full of it; his face was gobbed with it, and
drops of it fell off the end of his trickling
Dutch <em>muss</em>-tash. To say nothing of them
nice new clothes! Steve hollered, and I hollered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
and the Injun hollered. We <em>more’n</em>
hollered; we rocked on our heels and laid
back our ears and screeched—Falk looking
from one to the other, oozing slough-juice at
every vein, and wishing he had been buried
young.</p>

<p>“At last he kind of whimpers out, ‘Well,
what are you going to do with me now?’</p>

<p>“‘Kika-lap!’ says Rip, ‘fly.’</p>

<p>“And Falk flew, like a little bird; up the
side of the pot-hole, over the coulée and
across the prairie—vanished, vamoosed,
faded, gone for ever. He didn’t even stop to
pack his clothes. The first train out was soon
enough for him.</p>

<p>“So now you say he’s fallen into a bushel
of money, and has a fine house, and drives
his trotters in New York? Well! By gum!
But this <em>is</em> a strange world! Why couldn’t
some decent man have gotten the rocks? I
tell you what we ought to do; we ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
take a nice photograph of that pot-hole, of
which the general features are impressed on
his memory perfect enough not to need no
label, I guess, and send it on to him with the
compliments of Bloody-Ripping-Thunder,
for him to hang as the principal ornament
in his art gallery! Old Falk a millionaire!
Well, wouldn’t that cramp you! I’ve got to
have something to take the taste of that out of
my mouth. Yes, the same, Jimmy, with
plain water on the side. Well, here’s luck,
young feller, even to old Falk!”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LITTLE CANOE<br />

<span class="subhead">ITS INTRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION
AT PORTO RICO</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> friend the Señor Don is of a precise
and military bearing, clad with a dignity
that enhances his scant five feet of stature
to herculean proportions. He is a handsome
little man with pompadour hair and a bold
“Wilhelm der Kaiser” mustache. His speech
is exact, somewhat cold, yet with a flavor of
melancholy to it, like the style of Thackeray.
When he expresses himself in English, it is
with seriousness, that seriousness which marks
all his enterprises, but it is with some honest
mistakes concerning the language as a whole.
A fine love for our free institutions is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
characteristic of the Señor Don. I can not
tell you how his sad story of the little canoe
affects me. I may only try.</p>

<p>“When I am to mek retoorn to Puerto
Rico, Hooaleece” (which is part of my name
on the Spanish tongue), said he, “I have bear
in my mind the indolence of those people.
Not like that rooggèd American who enjoy
the manly art of boxing the eye of hees frien’,
or to mek strong resistance on the field of the
ball of the foot, or splash t’rough the water
in aquatic spooorts. No, hombre! Not
sooch do they mek in Puerto Rico. Nuzzing
more rrrrobust than to smoke cigarillos and to
drink chocolatay, and I say, Thees ees the end
of these people. What manner of civilizassyone
will mek the drinking of chocolatay
and the perpetual smoking of cigarillos?
That of the conqueror? No. That of the
arts? No. That of what, then? That of
nuzzing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
“Well, what then? I say, I shall to missionary
these people. To them I shall introduce
the can-ooo American. It ees a beginning.
Bimeby the boxing-glove, the ball of
the foot, the base-ball, but gradooally—poco
á poco. At first the can-ooo. There it ees to
sit still, after the manner of Puerto Rico, becows,
if you are not to sit with precceesion,
that can-ooo will to set up, and some man
must fish you. I buy can-ooo. I have it
transport at mooch expense. I veesit Señor
Córdova at hees home upon the sea, and there
also has arrrrrived my little can-ooo.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ says the señor, ‘what ees thees leetle
bo-at? Eet ees very pretty!’</p>

<p>“‘Eet ees can-ooo American,’ I tell heem.
‘You pull eet with thees stick. Eet ees at
your disposal. Will you not make essay at
eet?’ ‘Buen,’ says Señor Córdova; ‘where to
put the foot?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
“I am to tell heem, but he waits not for reply,
putting the foot oopon the edge. Eenstantly
that can-ooo make revolution, preceepeetating
Señor Córdova eento the ocean.
Ah, what confusion! What disturbance!
How mooch different from America! There,
when I have to overthrow myself in that can-ooo,
the hardy cour-rrage of those people mek
them to cry, ‘Ha, ha, goood eye! Pool for
the shore!’ But now! Señora Córdova and
Señoritas Córdova three mek lamentable outcry,
‘Papa is to drown!’ And those naygrose
which are there run around like stoopeed fellows.
Eet ees to me that the responseebeelity
falls that my friend Córdova do not perish.
There he ees, pushing the water with hees
hands, and speaking as one should not before
ladies.</p>

<p>“What to do? I can reach heem with my
arm, but that ees not nautical. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
by the—the—<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">como se llaman</i> thees pole with
the iron? Ah, bo-at-hoook! si, si, si! The
bo-at-hoook, and by that I hook heem.</p>

<p>“‘A Dios!’ he cry, ‘I am assassinated!’</p>

<p>“‘Be still, foolish person!’ I say. ‘Is not
your life to be saved?’</p>

<p>“‘Si,’ he say. ‘Tiene usted razón, but I
shall walk.’ So he place his legs upon the
ground beneath the water, which is not extensive
in that place, and coom to shore.</p>

<p>“‘Will you try heem again?’ I say.</p>

<p>“‘Causa admiración!’ he say, ‘I theenk not.
No sé the habeets of the little can-ooo.’</p>

<p>“So he send a naygro for stimulant, the
which I eembibe, while he mek change of
hees attire at hees house.</p>

<p>“When he has returned he say to me: ‘Let
us behold you master thees bo-at of eenstabeelity.
Can you mek heem go?’</p>

<p>“By thees time those stimulant have made
my heart strong, my cour-rrage severe. Am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
I not American citizen? What ees eet? I
tell heem that moment:</p>

<p>“‘I can pool eet with the stick; I can put
in the sail and fly over the water like a sheep.
Do you wish to see?’</p>

<p>“All the ladies and Señor Córdova cry out
they will not let me be so dangerous. But I
am resolved. Señorita Margarita Córdova is
a yoong lady ver-ree beautiful. I am an
American citizen. I tek anuzzer glass of
aguardiente—brandee. What do I care for
one can-ooo? Two? Three? I send the
naygro for the sail in a steady voice: ‘Pepe,
go at once and get the sail.’</p>

<p>“Señor Córdova says he will resist, but I
pay no attencion. I place the pole; I feex
the strings; I adjoost the ruddle; I put een
three large stone for ballass.</p>

<p>“‘Once more,’ say the ladies, ‘let us intreat—’</p>

<p>“‘At your feet, ladies,’ I say, ‘but I go!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
“So I go, and then for the first eet is pleasant:
the weend blow carefully; the little can-ooo
jump oopon the water. But now there
comes a large cloud. The weend he blow not
so carefully. I am far from home. On the
shore, Señor Córdova and hees ladies make
observacion with a telescope. It is sad, I
think, that they can see me so plain, yet am I
upon thees stormy ocean. Of what avail is
the telescope, if I am to shipwreck the can-ooo?
Ah! I would not at that time that I
had the ancestors of so cour-rrageous. Eet
ees one of them who make Rolando see hees
feeneesh. Out oopon these violent water I
am cara á cara with the ma’neefeecent past.
Shall I to turn the back upon the perilous?
Die, then, the thought! Beside, that moment
may the Señorita Margarita be with the beautiful
eye at the telescope. So I am gay; I
smile, as though I mek enjoyment of the terrrible
bouncing of that little can-ooo; I sing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
areea from <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Fra Diavolo</i>—ti-ti-tee-tum-te-tee!
But at heart I regret mooch. What is
a can-ooo, for the most? Eet ees not so
strong as paper; eet ees a small, little boat
that thees wave who shake hees teeth at me
may devour at a bite. And then, alas! comes
in a wave—ta! Ah, veree cold! Veree
damp! With my hat I mek attempt to hurl
the water outdoors. Comes another wave—another.
I labor desperate; eet weel not do.
Eet ees not enough. The can-ooo is sinking.
Bimeby I am to sit in the water. It happen.
Then I am to clasp the can-ooo with my arm,
for in the both end of eet exists an air-tink—a
box made of iron which hold the air, that
the can-ooo may remain upon the water.</p>

<p>“The stern of that can-ooo go down first;
glides the large rocks for ballass to where I
am sitting. Thees I am to t’row out. Pah!
When I bend to catch heem, comes a large
wave right down my neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“There am I, then, clasping that can-ooo
passionately, only hees end sticking up from
the water. Those large stone hold the other
end downright.</p>

<p>“At once I think, ‘Córdova shall survey
t’rough hees telescope, and send to me assistance.’
But on the second thought I see eet
ees not to be. I have mek sooch large talk of
what I may do with that can-ooo that Córdova
shall think: ‘Thees ees novelty American.
My friend shows me all! What devils are
thees Americans, to swim in a boat standing
oop in the water? Who shall presentiment
their leemitaciones?’ And he shall call hees
neighbors to see the es-pectacle. Everybody
shall come and remark, ‘Ah! Meeracoolous!’
and shake hees head.</p>

<p>“When I think that, I am almost to weep.
My friends to see me fish for fish with myself
before their eyes! Behold the beautiful Margarita!
Will it not to melanchate her days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
of youth to rrrremember, ‘Through a telescope
I saw my dear friend dissolve een the
water?’ Sad, thees. Well, then, eet ees unavoiadabble.
So to mek en end manful—strong.
Therefore I smile again. But that
smile he take all my strength. I wish not to
show disrespec’ for thees so noble country, yet
eet ees the coostom for to mek the dollar. On
that account some work is not so well done.
That air-tink, on which depend my life, he
leak. The can-ooo ees sinking, sinking. My
ear against hees side, I can hear that little
noise—shhhh!—where the water run in and
the air run out. Eet ees the hour-glass marking
how long I shall remain een the country.
When he feel oop—pop! A Dios, el mundo!</p>

<p>“And eet ees so slow! I am of eempatient
deesposeecion. With the long waiting I am
not simpatico. I look how fast the water
come up on that can-ooo, and I esteemate that
I have to sit in those cold water for five hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
And my friends observe t’rough the telescope!
Misericordia! Eet ees too dam mooch! For
five hours must I smile and sink!</p>

<p>“And when I think that Córdova shall say,
‘Ah, but he ees not eenteresting, thees fellow!
Eet ees a pairformance monotonoose to sit
there in the water! He ees not really an
American! Not sooch do they, I give my
word!’ then I geenash my tooth, and I shall
to tear my hair, but how may I unclasp that
little can-ooo?</p>

<p>“Now, to any man thees would seem suffeecent—a
meesery plenty for the heart to hold.
Yet listen! Here am I, three miles from
shore in the stormy ocean, grasping a sinking

to enjoy myself, to compensate my friends
who witness t’rough the telescope—ees eet not

perform? Shall I make a great splash with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
my feet to enfrighten that wrrretched repteel
away?</p>

<p>“And Margarita mek observation of me in
the actions of the little playful child. Ah,
my heart shall burst! In her eyes to become
reediculous! Si, yet here comes the shark to
bite me by the leg. To splash eet ees reediculous,
but what can be so mooch reediculous
as a man without some legs? Eet ees time I
splash. Vigorosely I the water spatter. The
shark, that cowardly insect, run away—only
to get hees friends. Around me they circulate,
each one putting oopon me the obstruction
of hees cold, unfeeling eye. And it rains.
In the air ees water! in the ocean ees water;
in the water ees sharks. I am tire of water;
I regret that I have not brought the ball of

<p>“I am think to be missionary; I am become
martyr. One consolación I obtain. The rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
eet has obscured the view. From the shore
they can not see. I am to smile no longer.
That ees joy. A little joy, not too mooch, for
now ees but a trifle of that can-ooo left elevated

splashing. I am deciding shall I omit to
splash, and thus allow thees beeest of shark
to bite me queeck, or shall I to drown, when—ta!
A hand on the stern of my t’roat, and
a voice t’rough the nose, a voice so beautiful,
a voice American, saying (eef you pairmeet

and I am lift into a boat.</p>

<p>“So they tek me to Córdova. My clothes
he ees shorten by the water; also hees color

<p>“‘Have you petroleum?’ I ask Córdova.</p>

<p>“He mek reply, ‘Yes, I have.’</p>

<p>“‘Of your kindness, obtain me some,’ I say
and retire unto the house.</p>

<p>“When I retoorn, the old clothes repose

<span class="subhead">THE REVERSE OF A MEDAL<br />

<span class="subhead">AN ACCOUNT OF THE MAKING OF MARY
ELLEN’S HERO</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mary Ellen Darragh</span> was a
strange girl. Her life may have had
something to do with that. Left fatherless at
sixteen, with a mother and three little Darraghs
on her hands, she at once jumped into
the breach, which in this case was the
breeches, and by the use of good taste, a
ready tongue, pleasant manners and plenty of
hard work, performed her stint so well that
now, at two-and-twenty, she was sole proprietor
of a millinery establishment which
employed four girls besides herself. Carriage-folk
came to the door of Mary Ellen’s
establishment, she was so good—and so cheap.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was born with both gray eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
wide open; she absorbed the deportment of
the ladies of her clientele with the unfailing
surety of grasp that made her a success. She
had the “business” of polite intercourse down
as fine as the most pronouncedly mannered of
her patrons—even to the English. The objective
case received all that was due it from
Mary Ellen when she had “her airs on,” as
her detractors put it. Now, these were no
airs; they were the girl’s standard. More
than the tilt of the head and a shade of the
voice were in them. There was the hope of
something above the buying and selling, and
wheedling of cross-grained customers.</p>

<p>Yet the effect on her acquaintances was bad.
They thought it buncombe, and although
Mary Ellen was trim, pretty and stylish, she
had never kept company with any young man
until Fireman Carter appeared on the scene.
Other young men had come, seen and left, saying
that kind of gait was too swift for them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Mary Ellen wanted to sit at a reasonable distance
from her caller and converse. It must
be added that Mary Ellen’s conversational
powers were limited—there was a measure of
justification in the course of the young
men.</p>

<p>However, Fireman Carter was of another
breed. He, too, had inner aspirations toward
gentility. Let me at once confute any suspicion
that Dick Carter was snob or prig. By
no means. Indeed, in his effort not to be superior
he sometimes exceeded the most ungentle
actions of his companions. The war
between his inner monitor and his desire to be
rated a good fellow played havoc with Dick’s
peace of mind. When he first put his cap under
the sofa in Mary Ellen’s little parlor he
recognized a quality in his hostess for which
he long had yearned. For one thing, he had
an opportunity to hold forth at length on that
subject so dear to the heart of man—himself.</p>

<div id="ip_106" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_119.jpg" width="394" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Mary Ellen was trim, pretty and stylish. <span class="in1"><a href="#Page_105">Page 105</a></span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Mary Ellen was smitten at first sight, and
why not? A mighty agreeable picture of
young manhood was Fireman Carter: thin,
clean, dark, handsome in face; tall, strong and
supple in body; alert and ready in mind; an
ideal type of the finest corps of men in the
world, the firemen. He looked especially distinguished
in his uniform. So Mary Ellen
listened to the song of Richard Carter.
Again, I must interfere. Dick didn’t blow
and bluster about his prowess; he merely took
out his soul and explained its works to Mary
Ellen. He left that night feeling he was understood
at last. And he went again every
time he had a chance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darragh, worthy old lady, chaperoned
the visits, an acquired idea of Mary
Ellen’s. She enjoyed her evening nap in
the parlor almost as much as the young folk
did their discussions. Little was she needed;
Dick appreciated his lady’s dignity too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to do aught to invalidate it. In fact, he
studied for those evenings, reading up by
stealth and artfully leading the talk to the subject
on which he was prepared, and then it
would do your heart good to see Fireman Carter,
with extended hand explaining the primal
causes of things, to Mary Ellen’s cooing obligato
of admiration. Solomon, in all his glory
was a poor fool to Dick Carter, in one person’s
estimation.</p>

<p>This was all very well, but Mary Ellen, like
most young women in love, would have liked
a more forceful demonstration of her idol’s regard.
She understood at last why her friends
preferred action to conversation. This long-distance
courtship might have been fatal to
another man than handsome, daredevil Dick;
as it was it added a piquancy; but it made
trouble, nevertheless, and here’s how that
came.</p>

<p>Under the softening influence of Mary Ellen’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
eyes, Carter had grown an intimacy with
a man of his company by the name of Holtzer.
Holtzer was German by parentage and sentimental
by nature. Especially did Holtzer
deplore the fact that he knew no nice young
women—those who liked music and poetry.
Dick gave him a “knock-down” to Mary
Ellen, and Holtzer also became a constant visitor.
The fact that it is bad policy to introduce
one’s best friend to one’s best girl can be
proved either by cold reasoning or by experience.
Carter tried experience. You see, he
would acknowledge to no emotional interest
in Mary Ellen when questioned by Holtzer—he
scouted the idea—so Holtzer wasn’t to
blame.</p>

<p>As for Mary Ellen, Cupid had pounded
her heart into a jelly. She was tender to
Dick’s friend to a degree that put the none
too modest German in possession of facts
that were not so. All the overflow of regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
he received as Dick’s friend he attributed to
his own personal charms, and, unlike Carter,
he didn’t hesitate to talk about it. It was Carter’s
pleasant duty to listen to Holtzer’s joyful
expounding of the reasons why the latter felt
he had made a hit with Mary Ellen, and not
only to listen, but to indorse. It shows the
stuff Fireman Carter was made of to tell that
he stood this vicious compound of insult and
injury with a tranquil face. The serpent had
entered Eden, and utilized Adam to support
his position, but Adam smiled and took his
medicine like a man.</p>

<p>Several times he intended to question Mary
Ellen concerning Holtzer, yet, when in her
presence, a certain feeling of surety and a very
big slice of pride forbade it.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was regaled with Mary
Ellen, per Holtzer, until violent thoughts entered
his mind.</p>

<p>Dick yearned for the first time in his life to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
do something heroic. He sweated to stand
out the one man of the day; to be held up
to the public gaze on the powerful pen of the
reporter. He wanted to swagger into Mary
Ellen’s little parlor covered and rustling
with metaphorical wreaths, and with an actual disk
of engraved metal on his broad chest, and thus
extinguish Holtzer beyond doubt—not Carter’s
doubt, nor Mary Ellen’s doubt, but Holtzer’s
doubt.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind he went to sleep one
night, to be awakened in the early hours of the
morning by a singular prescience born of long
experience, which told him the gong was
about to ring. For years the alarm had not
wakened Dick. No matter how deep his
slumber, he was always alert and strained to
catch the first note of it.</p>

<p>The metallic cry for help vibrated through
the engine-house. It threw each inmate into
action, like an electric shock. The dark winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
morning was savagely cold, with a wind
like an auger. The heroic cord was busted.
“Damn the luck!” cried Dick as he took the
pole; and it was no solo.</p>

<p>The two most picturesque feats of civilization
are the handling of a field-piece and the
charge of a fire-engine. Very fine was the
old-time chariot race, but what was the driver’s
risk on the smooth hippodrome track
compared to that of the man who guides a fire-engine
through city streets? The chariot
driver could, at least, see what was before
him; the man who holds the lines on an engine
little knows what’s around the corner. But
it’s a tale told too often already. A rush, a
clamor of hoofs, a roar, and they were rattling
over the pavement, the stream of sparks from
the engine stack and the constant lightnings
from the horses’ shoes making one think of the
old adage of fighting fire with fire.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Dick, clinging tightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
with one hand and waving the other in wild
circles as he got into his coat—“I suppose
some old lady has left the cat to play with the
lamp.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” assented Holtzer, “or else some
Mick has taken his pipe to bed with him.”</p>

<p>Then they cursed the old lady and the Mick
or whoever it might be.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is that I’m scart now,” confided
Holtzer. “I didn’t ust to care much, except
for the trouble, but now, when I think of
Mary Ellen, I hate to go shinning around taking
chances.”</p>

<p>General Bonaparte, the worst-mannered
conqueror in history, said that no man was
courageous at three o’clock in the morning, an
unmerited slight to the vanity of his soldiery.
However it may be as to courage, certainly
no man was ever philosophical when hauled
from his bed at that hour. It was in Fireman
Carter’s mind that a small movement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
his foot would put his erstwhile friend in violent
contact with the cold world below.
However, civilization isn’t impotent. He restrained
the action and replied: “You want
to leave your girl at home—fires is no place
for ’em.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” retorted Holtzer,
full of sentiment. “You can’t get away from
it. It ain’t thinking what’s going to happen
to <em>me</em>, so much, as thinking how Mary Ellen
will feel about it when she hears.”</p>

<p>“You’re awful dead certain on that part of
it,” said Dick, and now he hated his friend.
The last vestige of humor had left the theme.
“Perhaps she won’t care a cuss—how do you
know?”</p>

<p>Holtzer started to answer, while Dick listened,
his hands clenched tight—maybe there
was something he didn’t know about?</p>

<p>There was no more time for conversation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
As they turned the corner they saw their destination,
an eight-storied storage warehouse,
standing alone, with boarded vacant lots at
each side of it.</p>

<p>The watchman was there with the keys; it
was he who had turned in the alarm. Without
delay the firemen, hauling the hose up
after them, swarmed to the roof where the
flames were beginning to curl.</p>

<p>The fire was in the back of the upper story.
While some fought it on that level, the others
cut holes through the roof and turned the
streams down upon it.</p>

<p>The hose leaked and slippery ponds formed
in an instant where the water fell. The wind
sawed into one’s marrow in this utterly exposed
position.</p>

<p>A head popped up and called off all the
men but Holtzer and Dick.</p>

<p>“You fellers hold her down as best you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
can!” it shouted. “Keep a watch and don’t
let it break through—come on, the rest of
yer!”</p>

<p>They worked in silence on Dick’s part, and
with a continued rattle of what Mary Ellen
would think of this from Holtzer. It
wrought harder and harder on his companion’s
nerves, this prattle—indeed, such waves
of rage came over him that he entirely forgot
where he was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd below—gathered in
strong numbers in spite of the weather and
the hour—were wondering what must be the
thoughts of those men standing over a furnace,
a hundred feet from the ground. What
could either man think of but the danger?
The danger of one’s daily work? There is no
such thing.</p>

<p>This was a commonplace fire which soon
would be well in hand. It had not in the
least turned the current of the thoughts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
two men aloft who formed the spectacle, while
the household gods below made burnt-offerings
of themselves. Then, as if to show that
no fire is commonplace, a giant flare sprang
from the corner of the building, poised in the
air for a moment, then, overthrown by the
wind, toppled toward the firemen. They
leaped back—one to safety; the other, slipping
on a treacherous skin of ice, to fight vainly for
his balance for a second, and then to plunge
down the mansard roof, speeding for that
hard ground so far away. It was a trained
man who fell, though. He turned as he went,
instinctively gripping with his hands, and
they caught—the edge of the cornice—an ice-covered
edge to which they clung miraculously,
while his body dangled in the wind.</p>

<p>So Dick, safe, looked down at Holtzer, for
whom it was a question of seconds, while the
roar of pity from the crowd buzzed in his
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
He might well have done nothing. No
man could go down the steep slant unsupported.
Nothing was to be seen of Holtzer
but his hands, lighted by the flames; hands
that could not clench even, as to grip would be
to force loose, but which could only make stiff
angles of themselves. It would all be over in
ten heart-beats, for to take it as we are doing
is like examining the moving pictures one by
one at leisure, instead of as they live upon the
screen.</p>

<p>Then Dick moved. He ripped off his coat,
soaked the arm of it in the hose stream,
pressed it to the roof, where it froze fast on
touching, and slid down his improvised cloth
ladder, held only by the strength of the ice-film
that bound the sleeve to the tin.</p>

<p>Before his frantic fellow-firemen below
could scale the fence with the jumping-sheet
he had hold of Holtzer’s wrist with one strong
hand. The strain was terrible; he felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
coat yield with a soft, tearing sound, his head
spun, yet somehow he managed it, and there
they stood on the cornice together.</p>

<p>Then, while the crowd that had been as silent
as death cracked their throats with applause,
Dick spoke to Holtzer on a private
matter.</p>

<p>It so happened that a young man who did
“space” for a morning paper lived on the top
floor of the flat-house opposite, and saw the
whole thing through an opera-glass. He
hustled into his clothes and got down to the
street, working a talk out of Dick by the plea
that he needed the money.</p>

<p>The reporter was delighted. The incident
had the two elements of daring and mother-wit
that can be made into the long story of
profit.</p>

<p>“How did you ever come to think of using
your coat like that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, a feller I knew when I was a kid in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the country saved himself from drownding
that way,” replied Carter. “He fell through
the ice miles from anybody, and if he hadn’t
froze the end of his muffler fast, and so anchored
himself, he’d ’a’ been a gone gosling
all right. That thing come back to me on the
minute.”</p>

<p>That is why the first thing Fireman Carter
saw in his morning paper was his own name.
He started guiltily at the sight and threw the
sheet away. No maiden caught <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en déshabillé</i>
could have been more abashed; and, as the
maiden afterward might wonder how she <em>did</em>
look—was it so <em>very</em> awful?—so did Dick.
He picked the paper up again stealthily and
read all about it, lost in wonder at the end.
To the applause that came his way he turned
an inattentive ear, thus giving further life to
the old idea that the bravest are always the
most modest, which looks like a double superlative
and is no more true than that they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
always the fattest, or anything else. The
bravest are usually the most courageous, and
there ends deduction. Dick was busy with his
own thoughts—something troubled him. A
strange thing was the fact that though his
friend Holtzer scrupulously gave him every
credit he did not seek his society.</p>

<p>The frown of hard thinking was on Dick’s
brow all day. At night he asked for a few
hours off and got them.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen met him at the door. “Oh,
Dick!” she cried and gulped. “Ain’t you just
grand, though!” she said, and looked at him
with beatified gray eyes.</p>

<p>Here was golden opportunity. The proper
play for Fireman Carter was to reach out his
strong arms and gather Mary Ellen then and
there, but he did nothing of the sort. He
seemed distrait and worried.</p>

<p>To her anxiety, he seated himself on the sofa
and fumbled his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
“You ain’t mad at me, are you, Dick?” she
asked tremulously.</p>

<p>“Holtzer been here?” bruskly interrupted
her visitor with no apparent relevance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>

<p>“I—I—I told him ‘No.’”</p>

<p>Fireman Carter passed his hand over his
forehead, then drew out a newspaper, saying:
“You’ve read this, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“More especially this?” reading aloud the
most laudatory paragraph.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was not feazed by such flagrant
egotism.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” she said dreamily. “Just
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” yelled Fireman Carter, leaping
to his feet. The scorn in his voice could
not be rendered by a phonograph. Poor man!
He was about to knock the light out of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
gray eyes, to spoil his own image, and nothing
is so trying to a man’s temper.</p>

<p>“Hunh!” he continued. “Shows just about
how much intelligence you got—beautiful!
It’s a—lie—it’s fuzzy-water gas—there ain’t
nothing to it at all—d’ye understand that?”</p>

<p>This last came out so fiercely that Mary Ellen
faltered as she said she did.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Fireman Carter. “Now, I
want to tell you just one thing: I ain’t the man
to back-cap no man, when I come to get cooled
down—not with a girl nor nothing else.” He
tapped his knee with a perpendicular forefinger.
“Not with a girl nor nothing!” he repeated.
“Understand that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now I’m going to tell you the
God’s truth. Holtzer’d been making his
cracks about how he only had to speak and
you’d fall on his neck, until he had me so sore
I ached wherever m’ clothes touched me. So,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
when I see him coasting down the roof, the
one thing in my mind was that he’d go feeling
sure that he was the star with you. I couldn’t
stand that. No, sir! I couldn’t; so down I
goes after him. When I snaked him up on the
roof I tells him, ‘Cuss your thanks! I want
this much out of you, you flappy-footed slob—you
go to Mary Ellen to-day and see
whether she’ll take you or not—I’ll bet you
three months’ pay agin a cigaroot you get
turned down.’ Now, I was within my rights
there—but”—Fireman Carter stopped, wiped
his hands on his handkerchief, wiped his forehead,
blew his nose and swallowed hard.
“But,” he continued bravely, “if all the yawp
that pup of a newspaper kid got rid of has had
anything to do with changing results, I don’t
care for any of the pie. There wasn’t no ‘laying
down his life for another’ nor anything
of the kind in the whole play. It was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
like I’m telling you. Well, that’s all. I—I
thought you might like to hear about it.”</p>

<p>There was a lamentable change in the strong
voice at the last words. The speaker stared
at the door and drummed on his cap until the
silence became unendurable, then he raised
his eyes slowly, as a condemned man might to
the gallows.</p>

<p>There sat Mary Ellen, drinking him in, still
beatified. The meekest man who ever esteemed
himself poor relation to the worm that
squirmeth could not have mistaken the meaning
of that glance. It was simply adoration.</p>

<p>He straightened up and stared at her open-mouthed.</p>

<p>“I’ll be durned if I believe she’s heard one
word I said!” thought Fireman Carter.</p>

<span class="subhead">TEN MINUTES OF ETERNITY<br />

<span class="subhead">A REVOLVER, A RATTLER AND THE BOWL
OF A PIPE</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> warm June sunshine flooded the
prairie with light. A little frisky
breeze made silky noises in the grasses.
From the other end of the plowed ground
came the clank of harness and the thud of
hoof-beats, as the four-horse team drew the
sulky-plow, squeaking and complaining.</p>

<p>The monotonous work and soft air acted
on the driver like a sleeping potion, and he
nodded and drowsed on the seat, with the stem
of a pipe clenched between his teeth.</p>

<p>This man, Tommy, was for ever losing the
bowl of his pipe, and it was a great treat for
me, a boy of fourteen, to tell him of the loss
and hear him inveigh against the offending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
member with all the wealth of his Irish-Western
vocabulary. Tommy was full of strange
oaths and more bearded than any of his pards.</p>

<p>I giggled in anticipation as the plow
drew near—sure enough! The bowl was
gone.</p>

<p>“Tommy!” I hailed.</p>

<p>“Hay-oh! lad!” said he, snapping his eyes
open. “Whoa, there!—have yer come out
with ther grub call?”</p>

<p>“No, Tommy—but the bowl of your pipe
is gone.”</p>

<p>“What, again?” and he removed the stem,
regarding it sideways. “Now, ther curses of
the Mormon gods be on that bowl!” and from
that beginning followed an oration, lurid and
marvelous.</p>

<p>When he had eased his mind he said: “We
went down a hole over thayre, an’ I’ll bet it
was thin it jounced out. Let’s go and take
a bit of a look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
We were both busily turning over the sod
and searching, with our faces bent toward
the ground, when a voice said:</p>

<p>“Well, Murphy?”</p>

<p>No sound had heralded any one’s approach.
The question came so entirely unexpected
we both started and looked up.</p>

<p>There, seated in graceful ease upon a mound
of grass, was a lean, dark man, with a revolver
in his hand.</p>

<p>At this sight Tommy stopped rigid, still
half stooped. His broad, good-natured face
went gray in an instant. His eyes glittered
with fear. Twice he opened his mouth to
speak, and twice no sound came; but the next
time the words poured out in a torrent of
frantic haste.</p>

<p>“Stephens! I didn’t mane it! Lord God,
man! I take it back! Sure yer wouldn’t hold
it aginst me! I was wild drunk at th’ time—Fur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the love of Heaven, don’t shoot me!
I’ve got a wife an’ two childer.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s mouth went sideways in an
evil smile.</p>

<p>“You should have thought of that before,
Murphy,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Yer wouldn’t kill me before the lad, would
yer?” the other went on, his lips so dry now
that the words were no more than a whisper.</p>

<p>Stephens bent toward him with savage
quietness, and with the same set, twisted smile.</p>

<p>“I told you that I would kill you on sight,”
he said, “wherever and whenever that might
be, and I am here to do it.”</p>

<p>He raised the revolver as he spoke. A great
sob stuck in my throat. Through my head
went a roaring noise.</p>

<p>I looked from the one man to the other
in such a sickening ague of fear, that I could
not have uttered a sound to save my life. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
waited in this suspense for the report that
would shut out the cheerful quiet of the day,
like a black blot. In that second of deathly
silence between the men, the whispering of
the breeze and the clanking of the harness of
the distant horses seemed loud sounds.</p>

<p>Already I saw poor, honest, drunken Tommy
lying still upon the ground, looking with
dead eyes at the blue above.</p>

<p>But I saw a change come over his face, and
before I had time to wonder at it he spoke:</p>

<p>“Stephens!” he said, “don’t move fur yer
life! There’s a rattler widin’ a foot of yer
lift elbow!”</p>

<p>A contemptuous smile parted Stephens’
lips at what he considered a silly ruse, and
then it stopped frozen, leaving him with a
face like a mask, and sitting as rigidly motionless
as Tommy had stood but a moment
ago, for at that instant the devil of the prairie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
sounded his whirring warning of sudden
death at hand.</p>

<p>For a while all three of us were paralyzed—then,</p>

<p>“Oh, thayre he comes! He’s comin’ in
front of yer! Oh Lordy! Lordy! what’ll I
do!” shrieked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Keep perfectly still,” said Stephens,
scarcely moving a muscle of his face.
“Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“Howly Mary! His head’s a’most touchin’
yer hand!”</p>

<p>Stephens’ face turned to a green pallor as
the blood forsook the tan, but his expression
of calm self-possession never changed a jot.
There was a certain similarity that struck me
even at that instant between the finely modeled
evil head of the serpent and the man’s
clean-cut features.</p>

<p>They might have been a group in bronze,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
those two, for the rattlesnake had stopped,
motionless, with his head raised in poise; and
not the tremor of a muscle showed the man
was living.</p>

<p>“Oh damn! damn this country!” whispered
Tommy in an agony, “with never a stick nor
stone in it! What’ll I do, Stephens? What’ll
I do?”</p>

<p>“There’s a whip on your plow; send the
boy for it,” breathed he.</p>

<p>I backed carefully away from the horrible
spot, fearful the least sudden movement would
bring the man’s fate upon him.</p>

<p>Then I flew for the whip.</p>

<p>Returning, I placed it in Tommy’s hands.</p>

<p>“Now, kid,” whispered Stephens, “step
back and wave your coat. Hit, Murphy, at
your first chance.”</p>

<p>I did as directed, and the little fiery eyes
turned toward me. Tommy brought down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the whip-stock with such fury it shivered into
splinters. At the same moment Stephens
made a cat-like jump to the side.</p>

<p>The rattler lay coiling and writhing in his
death agony.</p>

<p>We three humans stood staring at each
other without speaking. A great deal had
happened within ten minutes, and speech is
for commonplaces—not for crises.</p>

<p>At last Stephens broke the silence. He
stretched his long arms, and yawned.</p>

<p>“I feel stiff—sitting still so long,” he said.</p>

<p>Without warning, my nerves gave way; I
burst into a strangled sobbing.</p>

<p>Immediately the two men began to pat
and comfort me.</p>

<p>“Why, kid,” said Stephens, “you stood the
rest of it like a thoroughbred; you mustn’t cry
now—there—there, brace up, old man!”</p>

<p>Between them they managed to quiet me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
and then Tommy turned timidly to Stephens.</p>

<p>“How about the trouble between us?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said the other, with a
wave of his hand. “I don’t feel just as I did
a few minutes ago.” He glanced down at
the still squirming snake. “If there is a
God,” he began, then stopped and shrugged
his shoulders.—“Well, so long. I must be
going. See you later.”</p>

<p>Tommy and I watched the slim, athletic
figure until it had swung down on to the
coulée out of sight.</p>

<p>“He’s a turrible man,” said Tommy, “but
not a bad one after all. Well, look! will ye?
I’ll be damned if thayre ain’t the bowl of that
pipe!”</p>

<p>And picking it up we returned to the
plow team.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Ten</span> thousand head of steers were waiting
for cars at Dundee. There was the Bar
Cross, the VV, the California outfit, the Double
Ess Bar, the 7 T X, the Bar A Bar, the Sacramento
Pool outfit and the Tinnin-Slaughter
wagon, all the way from Toyah. This last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
named had bought six hundred steers on Crow
Flat, road branded with two big Y’s, and
drove. When they got to Dundee they were
just a few shy of nine hundred head. This is
by the way, and inserted only as a tribute to
New Mexico’s unequaled climate.</p>

<p>The herds were camped in a circle around
the lake, keeping an interval of about two
miles from each other. Each herd had three
watches of three to five men each for night-guard.
But four or five men were ample for
day herding; so the men took turns at that, day
about, the unoccupied riding to Dundee in
search of diversions. Forty or more saddle-ponies
stood patiently unhitched, with dangling
reins, in the plaza.</p>

<p>The hotel did a rushing business, Mrs. Stanley’s
output making a pleasant contrast to
camp-cooking. Norah, the bright-eyed, was
besieged in form by relays of admirers, the
more favored ones being allowed to help cook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
or wash dishes. Perhaps it should be stated
in this connection that Norah was the only
girl in a section fifty miles square. All the
same, she was a jolly, pretty girl.</p>

<p>Now, when steer-shipping time comes the
season’s hard work is over, and all except the
“old hands” get their time. And while most
men of the cow countries drink colored fluids
on occasion, the superfluent ones, who consider
the putting down of liquor the first duty
of man, are not the stuff of which old hands
are made, the law of survival obtaining on
the free range as elsewhere.</p>

<p>So, after the first few days, drinking at Jim
Gale’s place became perfunctory, though, as
Dundee consisted of one hotel, one saloon, one
depot, one store, the section house and two
other buildings, the saloon was necessarily the
prime center. The boys would not be paid
until the cattle were sold, so gambling was
barred by etiquette, “jaw-bone” games being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
viewed with disfavor as tending to unseemly
contention. Similarly the code forbade more
than two or three persecuting Miss Norah at
once, and time ticked slowly.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sun in the east at morning—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun in the west at night,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">a cloudless sky, and a daily statement by a
badgered agent that the cars would be in at
once.</p>

<p>Given seventy-five full-blooded, vigorous,
healthy cow-boys, twenty-four hours in a day,
seven days in a week, and no work, and the
Purveyor of Mischief may be depended upon
to uphold their idle hands.</p>

<p>Inhospitality is mortal sin in all thinly-settled
countries, but all things have their limit.
For ten days a plague of tramps had overrun
the chuck-wagons, feasting on steaks, hot biscuits
and the like, getting a meal at one wagon
and on to the next. And when one left he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
spread the glad tidings up and down, sending
back seven others worse than the first, making
hospitality act like a camel.</p>

<p>It was Johnny Patton, cook for the Pool
wagon, that spoke unto Cornelius Brown and
Tinnin, of the Toyah crowd, suggesting the
advisability of slaying a tramp or so.</p>

<p>“Too harsh,” remarked Burt Mossman. “I
speak for a Kangaroo Court.”</p>

<p>“A word to the Y’s is sufficient,” said Tinnin.
Thus the pit was digged and thus the
net contrived, the three collaborators appropriating
the leading parts unto themselves. A
particularly “gall-y” and tenacious tramp,
who had adopted the V V wagon, was cast
for the star. He was to be “It.” Minor places
were filled and drilled; the rest of us were
Roman populace. The curtain rose promptly
after dinner. Brown and Tinnin began to
bicker.</p>

<p>Tinnin alleged that Brown had ridden to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the wagon for water and stayed for the whole
forenoon. Furthermore, he sang a few
stanzas from his favorite ditty, <i>The Expert
Cow-man</i>, as bearing on the subject in hand:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Put him on day herd, he’s sleepin’ all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First thing that starts out is sure to get away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes home in the evenin’, he’ll blame it on the screws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swear the lazy devils were trying to take a snooze.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Brown, highly indignant, demanded his
time. To this Tinnin demurred, saying that
Brown knew very well that he, Tinnin, would
have no money till the steers were sold. They
squabbled, L. C., until the others pacified them
and proposed town and a drink to drown unkindness,
which they did, inviting the tramp
to go with them. To this he acceded joyously,
not having learned to dread the gifts
of the Greeks.</p>

<p>They took several sniffs at the peace-pipeline.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
Then Brown launched into an interminable
yarn of hairbreadth ’scapes and ventures
dire. Every time he named a new man he
gave that man’s ancestry, biography, acts and
connections, with any collateral information
at hand. And the more he talked the further
he got from the latter end of his tale.</p>

<p>Tinnin got unsteadily to his feet. “Hol’
on!” he said. “Hol’ on! That ’minds me of
a <span class="locked">song—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He’ll tell you of a certain trip he made up the trail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taking half of Kansas to finish up his tale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s handled lots of cattle, and this is what he says:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s getting sixty dollars the balance of his days.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>At this insult Brown stood on his tiptoes.
“What!” says he, and jumped forward. Ward
and John Henry Boucher caught him. There
was a terrific scuffle, yells, howls: “Leggo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
there!” “Look out! He’s goin’ to shoot!”
etc. Same business for Tinnin, worked up
most spiritedly. Those who had to giggle left
the room.</p>

<p>We got Brown out and hustled him to camp,
calling on the tramp (his name was Harris)
to assist.</p>

<p>Brown raged: “I’ve had good and plenty
of that song the last month! I’ve got a plumb
full of his slurs! If that (past-participled)
old blowhard throws any more of that (modified)
song my way, he’ll get it, and get it
hard! He’s been picking at me long enough.”</p>

<p>After the cattle were bedded down and the
first guard put on, there were four at the
Toyah wagon besides the tramp. Brown had
finished supper and was standing with his
back to the fire, smoking, when Tinnin rode
up. He dismounted and came staggering out
of the dark into the firelight. Pausing a moment,
he began hilariously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To show you that he’s blooded and doesn’t mind expense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stands around a-scorchin’ of his eight-dollar pants!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Brown whirled. “Have ye got a gun?” he
snarled savagely.</p>

<p>“Betcher. Always!” said Tinnin; “and I
know how to use it.”</p>

<p>Crack! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>They emptied their guns over the fire.
Harris was sitting directly between them.
They were using blank cartridges, but of
course Harris didn’t know that, so he went
right away.</p>

<p>When he came back Tinnin was stretched
out, all bloody (beef’s blood) over his breast
and face; the conspirators were huddled, whispering.</p>

<p>Harris came up scared, white and shaking.
Ward and Brown grabbed him. Says Ward,
gritting his teeth:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“My bucko, you’ll swing for this!”</p>

<p>It flashed on the tramp that they meant to
lay the “murder” on him. He begged awful
as they took him in, leaving the corpse and the
cook to watch the wagon. It was great sport
from our point of view—and in that light.</p>

<p>In town Brown told the boys the tramp had
killed poor Jeff; and turned him over to
Mossman, the “appointed” sheriff.</p>

<p>“Judge” Charlie Slaughter called court in
Gale’s saloon. All the boys were there, and
most of the tramps—(they were <em>not</em> in on the
joke). The station-agent was made counsel
for the defense, and the trial began, with all
the formalities that anybody could remember
or invent.</p>

<p>A weird vision blew over from the hotel—a
frock-coated, high-hatted, gold-eye-glassed,
bold-faced man with an elbow crooked in
latest fashion. He would have been a spectacle,
ordinarily, but now we accepted him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
as a man and brother. We explained the situation
to him, and that all the boys had blank
cartridges.</p>

<p>McClusky and Jones testified to the killing.
They made it wanton and deliberate murder.
Ominous growls arose from Roman populace.
Prisoner’s counsel cross-examined unmercifully,
but they stuck.</p>

<p>The prisoner told his side—told it straight,
too. He broke down, cried, and begged for
mercy, said his life was sworn away, that
Brown was the guilty man. Some of the fun
departed.</p>

<p>The judge said witnesses for the prosecution
were trustworthy men of high standing, and
committed the prisoner to jail at Hillsboro to
await action of the grand jury.</p>

<p>“Lynch him! Lynch him!” shouted Boucher,
jumping up. The judge promptly fined
him fifty dollars for contempt of court, which
was as promptly paid, Boucher borrowing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
money of Gale. Every one was as solemn
as an owl.</p>

<p>“Any further advocacy of lynchin’ in this
court,” said Slaughter sternly, “will get the
offending man or men three months in jail.
There is no doubt in my mind as to the prisoner’s
guilt, but if he’s executed it will be by
due process of law. Mr. Sheriff, swear in
deputies to guard this prisoner. Take him to
Hillsboro on the midnight train.”</p>

<p>So Mossman appointed his brother Dana,
Kim Ki Rogers, Pink Murray, Frank Calhoun
and Henry Street. Then Slaughter adjourned.</p>

<p>Mossman and his posse were about half-way
to the depot when the whole crowd overtook
him.</p>

<p>“Now, Burt,” said Boucher, “we don’t want
any trouble with you—but we want that man,
and we’re going to have him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
“Hang him! Hang him!” howled the mob,
the guns click-clicking through the little stillnesses.
If there’s a worse sound than a mob’s
howl, Hell’s kept it for a surprise. I don’t
wonder the hobo turned into a bag of skin,
even at the imitation.</p>

<p>“You can’t have him!” Burt’s voice sounded
dead earnest. He was a good actor. He
handed the prisoner a gun. “Here—defend
yourself. Get out of the way, you bums, or
take what’s coming!”</p>

<p>That was our cue. A fusillade of blank
cartridges covered our rush. The officers
made a game fight.</p>

<p>Curses and screams showed where their unerring
aim mowed down the Romans, but
they were outnumbered. One by one they bit
the dust. Mossman, the last one down, gallantly
raised himself on elbow, fired a last
defiant shot, groaned and died. Then all was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
still; a ghastly silence which Boucher broke.
“This is bad business—but they would have it.
Is the killer hurt?”</p>

<p>He had miraculously escaped. So we took
him to a telegraph pole and put a rope around
his neck.</p>

<p>“Let me say a word,” he gasped.</p>

<p>I like to remember that even a tramp can
stand up and look at the Big Dark. He didn’t
cry now; he’d lost sight of himself.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, quiet, “I ain’t begging. If
I’d ’a’ done what they said it would put you
straight. I’m only sorry so many better men
was killed over me. You are doin’ what you
think is right. But that man yonder—that
Brown—killed Mr. Tinnin. Him and them
three men lied. Tinnin’s blood and my blood
and all the other boys’ blood is on their souls.
I wouldn’t swap with them. I wouldn’t want
to live and be them. But you’ll find out some
day I told the truth. That’s about all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
“Any word to your folks?” asked Boucher.
“Want to pray?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no folks—and no notion how
to pray,” he answered, catching at the nearest
man to keep from falling. Then he steadied
himself and looked up and around as if searching
among the reeling stars for the Heavenly
Help of whom he’d heard so much.</p>

<p>It was as ghastly as those waxwork figure
murders. I sweat plenty. It was worse than
if we’d been in earnest, by the whole dum
multiplication table.</p>

<p>I reckon Brown and the rest got worrying,
too, for Brown forced his part. “Let me
speak to him for a minute,” says he. Under
pretense of talk he unlocked the handcuffs.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this,” he whispered. “Horses
is all over yonder, and guns mostly empty—cut.
Quit the railroad and slide across the
Jornada. If you make the bushes maybe you
can break clean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
People are curious. Harris had been
braced to die, but the minute he saw a chance
he flew. I think I’d acted in that curious way
myself, maybe.</p>

<p>We took after him, yelling “Catch him!”
and “Get your horses!” and firing scattering
shots. We run him a half-mile, then we came
back, laughing and screeching.</p>

<p>But when we got together—a houseful of
us—and begun to talk about that poor cuss
hiding and trembling in the dark, Neighbor
Jones blew a smoke-ring in the air and stuck
his finger through it. The ring disappeared.
“Where’s <em>that</em> joke gone?” says he. And we
all looked cross-eyed at our drinks.</p>

<p>But there wasn’t a hobo on the Jornada the
next morning.</p>

<p>A lot of us felt mean next day. But a good
half was too young to have sense; the men
that had been on guard hadn’t seen it, and a
lot more were used to being part of a crowd;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
otherwise the first night of the Dundee comedy
would have ended its run.</p>

<p>Probably it would have been that way, anyhow,
if “Aforesaid” Smith hadn’t got too
many aboard. For a week after our hanging-bee
tramps passed Dundee—probably warned
by their underground telegraph. Then hobos
straggled in. The young—and therefore
hard-hearted—wanted another court at once.
Wiser counsel prevailed, however, until the
tenth day.</p>

<p>The sidings were full of cars, the buyers
had cut the herds, and a few train-loads had
pulled out. All the “culls” were thrown together,
to be cut again when shipping was
done, and driven back to their respective
ranches. And—all of the boys had been paid.</p>

<p>At this juncture “Aforesaid” fell by the
wayside, and went to sleep under a spreading
soapwood tree. That was an old chestnut of
his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Now, Will Borland, suffering from remorse,
had protected and kindly entreated a
new tramp at the 7 T X wagon. Will was
afflicted with a nasty conscience that never got
to working in time to keep him out of meanness,
and then dealt him misery after it was
everlastingly too late.</p>

<p>Well, this hobo of Borland’s came along
and went right through “Aforesaid’s” clothes
to the tune of ninety dollars. But Neighbor
Jones saw him.</p>

<p>They rounded up the hobo when he got to
town, found the money on him, woke “Aforesaid,”
and compared profit and loss. So, after
supper, they desired to give another reading
of the “Kangaroo Court.” There was considerable
opposition to this, and several stayed
away, to their everlasting joy. But most of
the remonstrants joined the majority, as this
lad needed punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
The cast was different this trip, Kim Ki being
sheriff and Hopewell judge. All went
merry as a marriage bell—with a few variations—until
just after the holler of “Lynch
him!” smote the air. Then that frock-coated,
weird and unknowable stranger, who had
boarded at the hotel all this while, addressed
the court with diffidence and timidity.</p>

<p>“Your Honor, may I have permission to say
a few words?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh—I suppose so,” said his Honor.
“Only be short.”</p>

<p>The stranger removed his eye-glasses and
polished them while he looked over the crowd
with a benignant smile.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, gentlemen, if I detain you a
moment. Let us forget this bum and your
monkey business. I have been much pained
to overhear the comments of some of your
number upon myself. You boys are so frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
and fearless and free”—another oily smile—“and
are careless, perhaps, of giving another
pain.”</p>

<p>He lowered his voice confidentially. “Now
this pained me more, as you hit very close to
fact. I <em>was</em> once an abandoned and ungodly
man—but I have been shown the error of my
ways, and now it is my firm intention to become
a missionary.” He put the glasses in
his breast-pocket, slow, thrust the handkerchief
under his coat-tails, slow—and produced
two cannon too quick for eye-sight—nothing
but a flash.</p>

<p>“Don’t be rash,” he said in kindly tones.
“His Honor will tell you my colleague is
standing at the back door. Is it not so,
Judge?”</p>

<p>“Yes-es!” stammered the judge.</p>

<p>There was a silence thick as custard.</p>

<p>“I will not insist on the formality of putting
up your hands, gentlemen; as the poet hath it:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Now, <em>I</em> know <em>your</em> subtle ways, being
aware your guns are loaded with blanks. I
offer in evidence that no one should try to reload.
My colleague will proceed to testify.
Doc,” he called across us, “try the clock hanging
over my head—hold its little hands as they

<p>“Ker-bang—two shots.” A bullet-hole appeared
neatly in the center of the III and another
just inside and over the IX. The time
was 9:15.</p>

<p>“Fair—fair!” said the missionary, gently
chiding. “My brother’s left hand can’t do
just what his right doeth. Still, I’m satisfied
with my pupil.”</p>

<p>His voice was rich and unctuous, and one
eye rolled upward sanctimoniously—the other
kept strictly to business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
We listened, fascinated—some one snickered.</p>

<p>Our friend cleared his throat and continued:</p>

<p>“We realize we could rake a tidy sum out
of this bunch if we were grasping. But if we
get exacting there’s three possible bad results.
First, it would entail considerable hardships
on you, and on all those to whom you are indebted.
Secondly, it would arouse evil passions
in your hearts.</p>

<p>“Lastly, and most important to us, you
would probably make us try high jumping
over the hills and far away.</p>

<p>“So we make you a proposition which will
strike you as being eminently reasonable.
You are a playful crowd, fond of your little
joke—Ah! speaking of jokes, pardon me
one moment. Prisoner, you are discharged.
Let this be a lesson to you, my dear brother,
to be honest and upright in all your dealings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
in the future. Do you know, if I were you, I
would not stay here? Going? <em>Good</em>-by!
God bless you!—To resume: We could take
your money, your guns and all your saddled
cattle, and quite probably break away safely.
But we would be sorry to cause you more
than a temporary inconvenience, and we
freely admit that you would give us the chase
of the century. If we should be unfortunate
enough to be captured you might prove vindictive.</p>

<p>“In view of these considerations, we would
like to have the matter go off like a little pack
of firecrackers among gentlemen; especially
as we do not think you will take strenuous
measures to pursue us—our capture would put
the monumental kibosh on you for ever.</p>

<p>“You could hang us, but the way we stuck
you up would be told for years to come. If
you see fit to keep the matter private, we will
not mention it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
“This is our moderate proposition: Let
each of the foremen throw one hundred
plunks in the plate, and each of the range-riders
fifty. The owners shall contribute one
dollar a head on each of their steers. That
is less than the biblical tithe, as they have sold
for fourteen dollars a head.</p>

<p>“We regret that two owners were unable to
see the humor of your festivities, and that
three foremen and some twenty of the boys
thought your fun too one-sided. Still, over
seven thousand head of cattle are represented
here, besides five foremen, and fifty of the
boys at fifty dollars each, making, say, ten
thousand dollars altogether. Come up! The
center table looks lonesome.</p>

<p>“Voluntarily donate so much to the good
cause, and pledge your words to give us an
hour’s start before Uncle Tomming us. Sixty
minutes you hold your dogs.” He stopped
and set himself. Says he, through a thin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
tight mouth: “Otherwise we take all and risk
all. Let her come quick.”</p>

<p>Dana Mossman spoke up: “Your proposition
is all right with me, Parson. I am much
interested in mission work myself. But I
want to call your attention to Frank Dodds
here. He wasn’t in on our little witticism the
other day, and only came along to keep us
from going too far to-night. He swore he’d
tell the hobo we was only fooling before we
got the rope around his neck.”</p>

<p>“The point is well taken,” said the Parson
pleasantly. “Your attitude is sportsmanlike
to a degree, and does you great credit. Mr.
Dodds may pass. Now, has any other gentleman
any suggestion to make?”</p>

<p>“A nice point arises in my mind as to what
would happen if we resisted,” said Tinnin.
“You couldn’t kill all of us, you know—and
when we did get hold of you you would find
it a matter for subsequent regret.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
“Very true—ve-ry true,” said the Parson
musingly. “Yet not one of you knows but <em>he</em>
might be the one to have bad luck. We count
on that—and you must count that, expecting
no mercy, we should show none.”</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s so, too. I’ll tell you what I’ll
do. Leave out the horse-wranglers—they’re
just boys and don’t know no better than to
follow us—and I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about the horse-wranglers.
It might be a valuable lesson in
the future. They can not learn too early to
avoid pleasure which gives others pain. What
do you say, Doc?” This to the silent one.</p>

<p>“Boys free,” said that vigilant person. “Cut
it short! You talk too damn much!” And
that was his only remark that evening.</p>

<p>“All right. We had set our hearts on clearing
up an even ten thousand, though. I see
some steer buyers of a facetious turn here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Perhaps they will be good enough to make up
the deficiency.”</p>

<p>The Colonel spoke up deprecatingly:
“Now I do not for a moment desire any bloodshed.
But as to taking all our money, remember
that ninety per cent. of it is in checks.
You couldn’t use them, you know. And I certainly
do not carry a thousand dollars with me
in cash. I’m willing to give you what money I
have—but I can’t pay you one dollar a head.”</p>

<p>“Vent slips,” said the Parson. “Your quota
is twelve hundred head, Colonel. Don’t try
to fudge. It would be difficult to realize on
all of it—as you justly observe. Still, much
can be done by two resolute men. We might
take a few of you out in the brush and shoot
you some if the checks were not paid. I fancy
you would see that they were. ‘Skin for skin,
yea, all that a man hath will he give for his
life.’ Really, you tempt me. One hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
thousand dollars is a big stake, worthy of a
bold throw. But let us not be covetous, my
brothers.</p>

<p>“As to the other matter, I happen to know
that Mr. Gale had ten thousand dollars sent
down to cash checks with. You owners either
give him your checks for your contribution, to
cash, pledging your words as gentlemen and
cow-men to redeem them, or we will clean out
the crowd, safe and all, and take you check-men
out to herd, till we have a friend negotiate
the paper.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Gale will cash the checks for you
we will let him go free. I am sure he will—for
if he don’t I’ll draw a check for it all,
and I know he’ll cash that! Speak up. All
or part! The time has passed pleasantly, but
I must go. You have indulged in Terpsichorean
recreation and you are now under obligation
to remunerate the violinist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Neighbor gasped. “How was that again?
I only speak English and Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Ante up!” quoth the Parson.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Copper your jaw and take what you want,”
said Slaughter. “None of us is looking for
getting killed. And <em>I’m</em> not going to push a
foot after you, for one. It serves us right.
Come on, boys. Hurry up—I want to go to
bed.”</p>

<p>So said we all of us. Kim Ki and Neighbor
passed the hat. The cow-men drew checks.
Gale cashed them. The Parson counted up.
It was a little over nine thousand six hundred
dollars, and they made the buyers draw checks
then to make up the even ten thousand.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to doubt your integrity,”
says he with the hand-on-the-chest act. “But,
as a precaution against carelessness, the Colonel,
Mr. Tinnin, his Honor and Mr. Mossman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
will accompany us for an hour or so.
Good night, and pleasant dreams! Try and
control your humorous propensities. Charmed
to have met you, I’m sure—and I hope to meet
you Hereafter (with a capital H)—boys—not
before! Good night!”</p>

<p>And they went out the door with their
hostages.</p>

<span class="subhead">CAMP CUNNINGHAM<br />

<span class="subhead">THE STORY OF A DAKOTA STORM</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> population of Dakota in the early
days was miscellaneous, to say the least
of it. Men from every part of the world,
from every station in life, and for many reasons,
hobnobbed together in terms of free and
equal intercourse. All social rules were
turned topsy-turvy—or rather, ceased to exist.
You could get a German baron to plow your
garden for you, if you wanted style, and were
not particular about the aim and scope of the
furrows, and perhaps while the baron was
plugging away, desperately struggling to keep
the plow from emulating the exasperated
worm of the old story, Jimmy O’Brien would
come sailing by behind his team of 2:30 trotters
on his way to deposit the money obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
by wise government contracts, and sing out a
jovial greeting of “Stick to ’um, Bar’n, old
man rocks! Thot’s th’ road t’ wealth—but
ye’ll be a toird man when you land there!”
And the baron would wave his hand in acknowledgment
of the greeting, and smile
grimly to himself in acknowledgment of the
statement.</p>

<p>All manner of younger sons inhabited the
country, making nonsense of the occupations
they took up under the disguise of earning
an honest living, and for which, as a rule,
they showed a superb incapacity.</p>

<p>One of these scions of a noble house was
James Cecil R. DeG. Cunningham—often
known as Slim Jim or Pelican Cunningham—sometimes
as just plain Cunny. He had a
tent on a homestead on the banks of the
Chantay Seeche River. It was a very clean,
white tent. All the empty tin cans were piled
up outside, like cannon-balls in a fort, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
every morning the estate was carefully “policed.”
No scraps and odds and ends littered
the courtyard of Camp Cunningham.</p>

<p>“Like master, like man,” says the saw, and
in this case truly, for the man Cunningham
was exactly like the master Cunningham-sur-le-Chantay
Seeche. No matter what his
work was, he always managed to look as if
he had just come from the wash—not that
he was beautiful, but he was so chalky clean.
His hair was clean, a peculiar no-color-at-all-cleanliness;
his teeth were clean, and almost
the size of piano-keys, when disclosed by his
wide, good-natured smile; his eyes were pure
white and pale blue. They showed behind
the powerful lenses that corrected their myopia,
like specimens of old china in a cabinet.
They also had something of the trustfulness
and instant claim for sympathy in their short-sighted
stare that one often sees in children’s
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Cunningham was full six feet two in stature,
bony and loosely put together. His legs were
of such length that Billy Wykam’s remark,
that, “if it wasn’t for his necktie, Cunny would
be twins,” had more foundation in fact than
most hyperbole. But his walking gait was
the most remarkable thing about him physically.
He took immense strides, swinging his
arms to their full extent, in unison, while his
head had a continuous pecking motion. Paul
Falk, our intellectual giant, said that Cunningham
in action looked like a demonstration
of a transverse vibration, and at rest like
Cunningham, and nothing else on this or any
other planet. He was one mortally homely
man, if ever there lived one, yet there was
something high and striking in his long, big-nosed
face, and a genial quality in his perfect
manner that would win you to liking him at
the first meeting and for ever after. His was
the style of the true nobleman, and gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
for him the respect of the hilarious crew
among whom he lived, despite his oddities.</p>

<p>Many a quiet kindly turn, so carefully contrived
that he never guessed it was a kindness,
he received from his neighbors; and for his
part no man could have been more willing or
useless. With an ax in his hand he was the
most dangerous companion imaginable. He
nearly brained two of the boys before they
could think of an excuse to part him and his
weapon without hurting his feelings, and
when he started to help in an undertaking,
not the least of the troubles of the others was
to render him harmless. On one occasion
Billy Wykam had a matter of twenty or thirty
calves he wished to brand. Cunningham was
in the corral, armed with a rope, intensely
serious and businesslike. He tripped up almost
everybody with the ropes; he “shooed”
the wrong “critters” out of the corral, so that
somebody had to take horses and chase them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
for miles over the prairie until they could
be secured again; he roped Antelope Pete
by mistake when the latter was flying down
the corral towed by a powerful yearling, and
gave Pete a fall that it would take years to
blot out of the spectator’s memory; then in
his zeal he hauled away on the rope, dragging
his victim quite a distance before he could be
stopped.</p>

<p>It was as much as the rest of us could do,
so weak were we from laughing, to prevent
the angry plainsman from laying violent hands
on Cunningham, who, of course, was ignorant
of having given offense. In short, Cunningham
was so persistently where he ought not
to be, and so entirely in everybody’s way, that
some of the boys were like to die of suppressed
profanity. Billy asked Paul for mercy’s sake
to set the man at something where he wouldn’t
be playing the old Harry with things all the
time. Paul elected him to the position of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
branding-iron tender, whose duties are to heat
the irons, and hand them out when needed.
Even here the Englishman distinguished himself,
for, peering near-sightedly around with
a hot iron in his hand, he touched Billy’s
buckskin bronco on the flank with it. The
ugly little beast promptly kicked Cunningham
into the fire, and then tore around the corral,
spreading disaster and confusion. Poor
Cunny got several bad burns, for which the
rest of us were not as sorry as we should be,
inasmuch as they forced him to knock off for
the day.</p>

<p>If anything could have added to the absurdity
of Cunningham’s performance, it
would be that he was the “perfect gentleman”
all the while; explaining, apologizing,
or hazarding an opinion, it was always with
the little graces of the drawing-room. How
ludicrous this manner is in a rushing, dusty,
hot, swearing cattle-corral is a thing that has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to be seen to be appreciated. We always
tried to secure Cunningham’s services elsewhere
when we had something on hand which
we really wished to put through. The man
had a modest pride in his tent that it would
have been wicked to disturb, yet for his safety’s
sake it became a friendly duty to drop
him a word of warning. He had landed in
the country in the spring, and hitherto the
weather had been delightful, without an omen
of the furious storms that were sure to come
during the summer. It seemed to us that his
tent wouldn’t amount to much in the grass of
Dakota, but we didn’t like to tell him so. At
last we appointed Neighbor Case our commissioner
to acquaint Cunningham with some
facts we thought he had overlooked. After
praising the tent and its surroundings, Neighbor
came to the heart of his message.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty nice—mighty nice, Lengthy,
he said. “Yet, if you want my advice, I’ll tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
you what I’d do; I’d take a half hitch around
a boulder with them guy-ropes, if I was you.
Even then, you wouldn’t have no sure thing.
Wait till you see one of our little breezes
come cantering over the prairies, son; you’ll
wish you had a cast-iron tent, fastened to the
bowels of the earth with bridge-bolts.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I thank you awfully, old man,
for your interest, you know,” replied Cunningham,
“but,” inspecting his moorings carefully
through his glasses, “I think she’ll stand
it. The pressure of the wind on a normal
surface is only two pounds to the square foot,
for a velocity of twenty miles an hour, and,
of course, on oblique surfaces—like the tent-walls—much
less, much less. Why, even in
the cases of exceptional storms, the pressure
does not rise above eighty or ninety pounds,
and as I was careful to get only the best of
canvas and cordage, she should stand that,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Neighbor Case was impressed, if not converted.
“That’s a great head you have on
you, Lengthy,” he said admiringly. “You
seem to know old Mr. Wind’s ways as well
as if you and he had played in the back yard
together when you was boys; but I want to
tell you something. He may act like that in
books, and only press you for so many pounds
as you tell me about when you’re normal and
he’s hitting a certain gait, but you can’t tell
what he’ll do when he gets you out here all
alone on the prairies. He may forget the
rules and press you just as hard as he darn
pleases; or he may shift the cut and knock you
into a cocked hat before you can get the books
out to show what he ought to do. No,
Lengthy, book-learning is good, and you won’t
catch me saying nothing agin it; but if I was
you, I’d let it slide on this occasion, and tie
her up to a boulder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Cunningham, however, had a trait in common
with many gentle-natured people—that
of mild obstinacy—and he stuck to his tent
just as it was.</p>

<p>We could not urge him further, so there
the matter dropped—until the day of the
storm, then several other things came to earth.</p>

<p>We woke one morning to find the country
wrapped in a fury of red light—not the cheery
glow of daybreak, but a baleful crimson, as
though it were raining blood on a world of
fire. In the west a massive heap of storm was
rolling, against whose murky blackness the
small buttes stood out ruddily. It was a boiling
storm; the vapors curled and twisted in
a way that meant wind and hail, and plenty
of both.</p>

<p>“By the great Hohokus! We’re going to
catch it this trip,” said Billy, and the three
who composed the household of his ranch began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
scrambling about in nervous haste, gathering
up the things that might be blown away
by wind.</p>

<p>In the middle of it he called out to me,
“Say, Hank, don’t you think we ought to give
old Cunny a lift? Here’s where his shanty
comes down, sure!”</p>

<p>This was more than kind of Billy, for about
the only thing in the world he feared was
thunder and lightning, and this filled him
with a dread that neither his strong will nor
good sense could in the least abate or control.</p>

<p>Of course, I could not refuse. We started
on a run for Camp Cunningham, a mile or so
down the river. Yet, though the distance was
so small, we had reason to doubt that we could
cover it. Half-way, a hailstone the size of
a child’s fist went whistling over our heads,
ricocheted along the sod in great bounds; then
came another and another—the skirmish fire
of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
The suggestive “thwuck” of these missiles
as they took the ground made me draw in my
head as far as possible—like a turtle.</p>

<p>I was just wondering what effect one of
them would have on the human body, when
a big fellow smashed fairly against the side
of Billy’s head—a sounding blow which
knocked the sturdy little man staggering.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get out of this,” he said,
grinding his teeth in pain, “or we’ll be slaughtered!”</p>

<p>A trickle of blood from a cut in his head
bore witness that this was not a figure of
speech. Let any one who doubts the Lethal
quality of a Dakota hail-storm stand out in
the open while a dozen or so expert ball-pitchers
open fire on him with pieces of ice,
weighing up to half a pound (the actual conditions
of the storms are sometimes a worse
matter than this comes to), and I fancy he will
soon be changed from a skeptic to a fanatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
If I had any doubts they were instantly removed
by a rap on the arm which numbed it
to the finger-tips. For a moment we hesitated,
but it was too far back to the ranch, so
we broke for the scant cover of some bullberry
bushes on the hitherside of Cunningham’s
coulée.</p>

<p>As we flattened ourselves behind these the
real storm was on us in a breath. We were
stunned by the uproar; the all-pervading
heavy drumming of rain and hail, and the hiss
of their passage; the yelling and booming of
the wind, and the thunder that smote the earth,
crash upon crash, like the blows of a hammer.
We did not think—we held on tight and
waited. One could not see ten feet into the
gray of falling ice and water, and the rush of
it nearly took one’s senses away. It all but
turned the level prairie into a seething lake,
and the slopes into rapids. Suddenly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
downpour ceased almost as abruptly as it began,
and nothing remained but the wind. I
say “nothing,” because that is our idiom. I do
not use the word in a depreciatory sense, for
we had full realization of what force there is
in mere air in motion that morning. It swept
across the prairie in one great tide of power.
There was not a flutter nor break in it. It
jammed us down in the mud, and then held
us there. At first it seemed as if our heads
would be whipped off our shoulders if we
dared lift them up into the full swing of it.
But this acme of energy passed at last, and
we turned our eyes down the coulée to see
how our friend had fared.</p>

<p>Tent Cunningham had so far fulfilled its
architect’s expectations. A swollen yellow
river from the coulée washed its edge and it
was plastered with mud by the hailstones, but
otherwise uninjured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
“He’s—weathered—it!” roared Billy in my
ear. “Yes,” I answered, “coulée—bank—protected—him.
He’s—all—right—if—”</p>

<p>I was going to say “if the wind doesn’t
shift.” But before the words were out the
wind had shifted.</p>

<p>Rrrr-oooo-oof! It shrieked down the coulée
and with a snapping and a cracking, like a
small Fourth of July celebration, away went
Tent Cunningham. The canvas rose in the
air, flapping tragically; and beneath it, galloping
in frantic haste, were the longest and
thinnest legs in the world, as poor Cunningham,
caught in the folds, was hustled onward.
We could see nothing of him but legs, and
as the flying tent bore a rude semblance to
the human figure, the combination looked like
a gigantic ghost, with slender black legs,
hurrying off to haunt somebody.</p>

<p>Such leaps and bounds as Cunningham
made were never equaled by the winner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
any Olympia, ancient or modern; and such
another vision never was beheld outside the
course of a nightmare. There was a fever of
madness in its curvetings, its gesticulations, its
wild plunges.</p>

<p>Down into the Chantay Seeche, all a-suds
from the recent bombardment, the specter
swooped, and then came a mighty struggling
and floundering.</p>

<p>Surely no more ignominious death could be
furnished the offspring of a noble house than
to be held down by a tent and drowned in
two feet of water!</p>

<p>We sprang, nay, we flew to his assistance,
for once on our feet the wind scurried us
ahead whether we would or no. We spaudered
and slid over the slippery mud, like novices
on skates, and we should have over-shot
our quarry but that we grabbed at the tent
in passing.</p>

<p>Now, it turned out to be in nowise so easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
to get the man out as you might think, for the
moment we lifted a fold of the canvas it
caught the air like a kite, and down we went,
under it, or over it, as the case appeared. In
the former instance, it was no small job for us
to get ourselves out again, let alone helping
Cunningham. The very devil was in the tent,
and it began to look as if the man would be
drowned right under our hands, when it occurred
to me to cut the knot of our complications.</p>

<p>I passed my knife over a bulging place
which I judged held some part of the victim,
and instantly the head of James Cecil R. DeG.
Cunningham popped through the opening—a
head from whose mouse-colored whiskers
and long nose the water dripped pathetically,
and which regarded us with injured but vacant
near-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>Poor Cunny! His mind must have been
thoroughly addled by the events of the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
for the first words he spoke—in the tone
of one declining an ice—were: “I don’t like
this kind of thing at all, y’ know!”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?” said Billy. “Well, if it’s
the last act, I’m going to laugh.”</p>

<p>He surely did laugh, and I with him. We
howled, and splashed, and slapped our legs
until we were too weak to stand up, and then
we sat right down in the water. Cunny set
up a stentorian “haw-haw” out of pure good
nature, and the sight of him, with his tent
around him like a toga, full of dignity, but
willing to oblige, as usual, went near to finish
us.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me, Cunny, don’t!” begged
Billy. “If you look at me again like that,
I’ll die right here!”</p>

<p>“Very good! Very good, indeed! Haw,
haw, haw!” replied Cunningham.</p>

<p>In the middle of the hilarity there came a
hail from the river bank in a voice of wonder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
It was Antelope Pete, mounted, on his way to
Billy’s to compare notes on the morning’s
flood.</p>

<p>Now, Antelope is a very serious-minded
man for the country, and it wouldn’t be well
to repeat all the different things he said might
happen him if he ever saw the like of this
before.</p>

<p>“Do you fellows always go out in the middle
of the river to crack jokes in thunder-storms?”
he demanded. “What in blazes is the matter
with you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>We tried to explain, but we couldn’t get
three words out before we were in roars again,
and Pete was perfectly disgusted.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to leave,” said he. “I’ve
got something else better to do besides sitting
here watching the most all-fired, copper-riveted,
three-ply, double-backed-action damn
fools that it was ever my luck to come acrost.”</p>

<p>We prevailed upon him, however, to throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
us his rope, and as Cunningham was so fearfully
and wonderfully entangled in the tent
that it would have been next to impossible to
extricate him, we tied the line to a corner of
the tent. Antelope then laid the quirt on his
cayuse, and man and mansion were hauled up
the bank together.</p>

<p>When we reached a state of mind where we
could discuss the matter calmly, we asked
Cunningham if he still intended to live in
the tent. Oh, yes, yes, indeed! The tent was
all right; it was the wind that was wrong.
Then followed a learned disquisition on vacuums,
and worlds, and other meteorological
phenomena which stumped us completely.
Indeed, it came to my mind that Cunningham
almost proved that he and the tent never
went into the Chantay Seeche.</p>

<p>Part of his theory which I can remember
is that the wind, in passing over the coulée,
partially exhausted the air beneath it, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
action of an atomizer, he explained to our
unscientific minds. And thus Tent Cunningham
was drawn up and on to disaster most
unlawfully. The idea of Cunningham and
the tent being “atomized” into the creek strikes
me as being particularly good. I feel still
more entertained when I think of the tin cans,
the ham, the bacon, the lantern, the little sheet-iron
cooking-stove, various articles of clothing,
et cetera, which were included in the
spray.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to add that the gathering
of all these was the work of most of a
morning. I don’t believe I ever saw anything
more pathetic than the little stove stranded
on a bar some distance down the river, its tiny
legs lifted in appeal to the now speckless
heavens. Perhaps it was thinking of the untimely
fate of the frying pan and kettle that
had warmed themselves at its fires so often.</p>

<p>When Cunningham gazed upon this jettisoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
cargo his face betrayed his feelings.
His soul, which loved cleanliness, order, and
system with a blind worship, revolted. One
could see that it was in his mind for the moment
to “jump the country,” but it passed.
The determination and courage which were
at the bottom of the man’s nature rose in force,
and he busied himself in restoring the former
status, singing a loud air without any tune
to it, the while. The territory of Dakota was
a large country—some of the belongings never
appeared again. It is pleasant to think that
Cunningham’s card-case may have fallen into
the hands of a wandering Indian, and thus
spread the refinements of civilization.</p>

<p>It seemed that our friend was going to buck
the elements on first principles—put up the
tent in the same old way, and have it blown
to Halifax in the same old way to a dead certainty.
There was no more use in trying to
argue with him on the subject than if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
a question of politics; but Billy, who used
more tact in one minute than I could understand
in ten, turned the point without the least
friction.</p>

<p>He asked Cunningham to expound the theory
of the levitation of the tent again. It was
done, at length, and breadth, and thickness.</p>

<p>“Now, as I understand it,” said Billy, “a
vacuum’s a place where there ain’t anything,
and when things try to get in it makes trouble—are
my sights at the right elevation?”</p>

<p>I assured him he was correct so far.</p>

<p>“Well, then, see here, Cunny, why don’t
you kind of fill in around the tent with sods?
You can’t make much of a vacuum out of good
deep-cut sods, I’ll bet my wardrobe. You
see the place where the vacuum would have
to be, to do you dirt, will be occupied and it
can vacuumize all it wants to around the
prairie after that, and you needn’t care.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
“An ex-cellent idea! “cried Cunningham.
“I thank you very much, Mr. Wykam.”</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Tent Cunningham
was surrounded by a wall of sod eight feet
high and four feet thick. The only criticism
I heard was from a stranger who put up at
Billy’s for a while.</p>

<p>One morning he came in and took me by
the shoulder, “Come with me,” he said. We
went on until Tent Cunningham hove in sight.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen lots of what strikes me as strange
things in this country,” the stranger said, “but
that place knocks the spots off the cards.
Would you be kind enough to tell me what
that wild-Injun-peaceful-settler contraption
is?”</p>

<p>“That?” I asked with a sober face. “Why,
that’s Camp Cunningham.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it is,” he returned. “But that
ain’t the point I was looking for. What I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
want to know is, why did the population go
to all the trouble of building a sod house, and
then put up a tent inside of it?”</p>

<p>“Merely a question of taste—it’s his hundred
and sixty; why shouldn’t he build what
he likes on it?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, too,” replied the stranger. “Excuse
me for meddling; it’s a free country, if
ever there was one.”</p>

<p>So the matter dropped right there.</p>

<span class="subhead">HOHANKTON, PETTIE AND
OTHERS<br />

<span class="subhead">THE TALE OF THE TRAINED PIG</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">“Do</span> you remember Red’s pig, Foxy
Bill?” said Hydraulic Smith. “Well,
I was in a camp that had a pig for its chief
feature, myself. He wasn’t a fat, comfortable
old lad like Foxy Bill, but a sort of cross between
a razor-back and a buffalo. He was a
little feller, with a mane on his head and on
his shoulders. He had high shoulders on
him, like a buffalo, but, as for the rest of him,
he was that thin you wouldn’t have known
him for a pig, except for the curly tail at the
end.</p>

<p>“He was our sole and only pet. We was too
high in the air for cats. They died of heart
disease. Nobody owned a dog. We called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
piggie Johanus Eliphas Hohankton for a
noted statesman in that part of the country, a
great man on the pension vote (believe he
drew three himself), that told us politics with
one wooden leg and a mouthful of language
trying to gurgle through Greaser Pepe’s gin.</p>

<p>“I think Hohankton discovered the lack of
dogs in town, for he tried to act the part as
much as he could. He’d go trotting up Main
Street, kind of sniffing at you and rolling his
eyes, give two or three squeals like a dog,
when you called to him, then sometimes he’d
go mosying around important, full of his own
business, just as you see dogs do.</p>

<p>“He took care of the coats and the lunch-boxes.
If a stranger came around he’d show
his tusk with his lip all curled up, and growl
something ferocious. He was a right smart
animal. I can see him now, going the lengths
of Main Street, sounding like a busted clarinet
player telling his woes in music, to let you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
know he was there, and that if there was a
doughnut or some apple-sass, or, in fact, almost
anything that a hog might like, you could
please your friend Hohankton by putting it
forth.</p>

<p>“But nothing in the world would get him
fat. He was built like a fish, fore and aft,
and in a straightaway I think he could hold a
jack-rabbit.</p>

<p>“The Judge, he was a heavy-built old man
who wore his chin on his breast most of the
time. When Hank walked alongside of him
he hunched up his back like the Judge, and
put on much the same expression, until the
Judge rumbled out, ‘Durn that hawg!’ and
give him a scratch on the back with his cane.</p>

<p>“Then, if there was a lively bunch, why,
Hank was merry, too. He would trot and
amble with one side, and gallop with the
other, make prancing steps, biting at his own
tail till an oyster’d laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
“We had miles of claims on the bank. The
pay was light, howsomever, and you had to
send about twenty acres down the stream to
get enough to pay the hands off. We had
plenty of water on a two-hundred-foot fall,
or it wouldn’t have paid for the trouble.</p>

<p>“Howsomever, we sent an almighty lot of
farm land down where the ranchers didn’t
want it. They objected to our covering their
vegetables with four solid foot of tailings, consequently
they kicked like anything, but it was
just mine job against vegetable job, and after
the law courts had been worn out and decided:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rose is red, the sky is blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We don’t know nothing, no more’n you,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and everybody had an injunction out against
somebody else, which he couldn’t enforce,
why it came back to our old friend, physical
trouble, again. The farmers outnumbered
us, but we ranked in the first class for physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
trouble, so there hadn’t been anything but an
exchange of personal remarks.</p>

<p>“There was just one rancher, who grew too
fast when he was young, and then stopped too
quick after he grew up, came at us fierce. He
called us all kinds of twisted crooks and
straight-out thieves he could think of. He
had it in for me particular. Once, as he got
to putting it on me, he grew excited, and began
to swing an ax around. He came nigh
hitting the stream one or two passes, and I
told him:</p>

<p>“‘You jay bird, you’ll be a-sitting and a-singing
on a limb if you monkey with that
little squirt of water. You are perfectly safe
from me during working-hours, but don’t fool
with our piping lay.’</p>

<p>“Not one man in a million knows what a
stream of water can do, and he was one of the
million that didn’t. So he r’ared up and said
he would splash the water over me, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
raised his ax. I had half a mind to turn the
lever and squirt him over the neighboring
bluff, but I had pity in my soul, so I hollers,
‘Don’t!’</p>

<p>“But them words was too late. He is one of
the very few men who will ever tell anybody
how he tried cutting a hydraulic stream in
two. While he was blasting me he wandered
about, sitting on his horse loose; the ax came
down. I was looking right plumb at him, but
just how, when and in what way he disappeared
I will never tell you.</p>

<p>“I followed the direction of the stream until
I found him. He was curled up on his back,
about half the ax handle in his hand. Soon
as I came in sight he hollered, ‘<em>Whoa!</em>’ I
stared at him. I come a little nearer, and he
yelled ‘<em>Whoa!</em>’ again, and tried to scramble
to his feet. I learned afterward that he’d been
a mule-skinner for a while and thought his
team had turned on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
“I grabbed him by the neck. ‘Now, you
horny-headed son of toil,’ I said to him,
‘you’ve learned one thing to-day. Keep on
doing that for three thousand, six hundred and
seventy-five days in the year and by the end
of that time you won’t put your thumb on the
buzz-saw.’</p>

<p>“‘You don’t mean to tell me a stream of
water done that!’ he gasps out.</p>

<p>“‘You have three shies at it,’ I said. ‘I’ll
furnish the axes, and every time that stream
doesn’t knock you one hundred and fifty feet
you get a new cigar. Want to buy in the
game?’ I shambled him off to his wagon and
dumped him in.</p>

<p>“He laid low for his revenge, like the
darned farmer he was, and meanwhile Hohankton
was the cause of our undoing. Animals
have a heap more sense about natural
things than men has. Hank got in the way of
following the boys over to the side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
creek. You know I used to undercut the bank
while the boys worked the big stone out for
me and loosened up the dirt here and there.
They was as careless fellows as you’d see.
Yet, at the same time, no man wants an eighty-foot
bank of dirt on top of him, and so they’d
be quite anxious in their minds for about five
minutes before the slide came.</p>

<p>“The first day Hank went over there he
threw up his head as though he smelled something,
straightened his tail, grunted loud and
away he went. The boys near got pinched
looking at him and laughing. When they
went back, Hank went back, and the next time
he blew his signal everybody departed. We
were not such a swell-headed crowd we
couldn’t learn a thing from an animal. Hank,
old boy Rocks, was just as right as he was
before, and after that he took up his position
as Official Notifier and he never went wrong.
The boys could work right along till they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
heard that squeal, and then do fast time to the
creek.</p>

<p>“We was proud enough of Hanky before,
but now he had this actual stunt of his that
we could prove to any or all lookers-on, our
chests stuck out till the buttons popped off.
Other fellows would drop in with stories of
dogs that had done all the wonderful things
that you have heard tell of, and cats that used
to milk cows, and horses that could figure up
to six times six, and all them lovely relations
that gets to be natural history around the
camps, and we could stand for it and say ‘Yes,’
just as if we believed it.</p>

<p>“Then we’d remark we had a pig in camp;
and wouldn’t say anything more until Hank
signaled, and the visitor would begin to open
his mouth to see everybody a-running, asking
why. Then down come the bank!</p>

<p>“Usually the stranger went and put up
money that it wouldn’t happen again. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
three times, though, he’d let go, scratching his
head and meditating: ‘It’s so—I see it’s so,
but how the blazes a pig knows more about
the acts of gravitation than a white man—you
tell me now?’ And we’d answer we weren’t
going to tell him. Let him find out, same as
we did.</p>

<p>“Well, he’d admit in a kind of grudging
way that that pig of ours was quite a curiosity.
Yes, he’d admit it, in a sort of easy, offhand
style, that old Hank was quite a curiosity, and
we didn’t have to say anything.</p>

<p>“They would go on from Placerville, working
the yarn up, until fifty mile away it
seemed we had a pig that could smell a pay
streak, always pointing, like a pointer dog,
when he smelled the gold; that he usually
walked back home on the hydraulic stream,
and that when it was time for a bank to fall
he would make sounds that sounded so much
like ‘Look out!’ that you couldn’t hardly tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the difference from a man’s yelling it, except
that it had a kind of pig brogue to it, as it
were, and so forth.</p>

<p>“We didn’t have to advertise Hank one particle;
even that gol-darned farmer heard of it,
and slouched around on the quiet till he see
how things lay.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the way he come near getting
even. If there’s anything I ever really did
love it is to get my hands on a monitor lever
and just feel that old streak of water flying
across, smacking, gargling and gurgling in the
earth, ripping her out, mud and suds a-flying
all over, rocks going, too, and just a little
touch bringing the blade in the stream and
swinging her around, because, you know, four
men couldn’t turn that nozzle by bull
strength, where just a little blade that cut into
it at each side made it turn like a delicate
vine.</p>

<p>“Now, I liked that as well as when I used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
to live back East in a little old town up in
New York, and it was my job to water the
front street, and when there come a carriage
along I always used to be absent-minded
somehow, and that carriage would run right
into the water, and then them good old aunts
of mine used to explain it, how absent-minded
I was, and the ladies that got wet wouldn’t
listen to it, and the nigger coachman and I had
it around the barn fast. Well, I was just the
same kind of kid again when the monitor was
playing, and the sun was shining, and the
clouds was sailing, and the grass was growing,
and everything that ought to happen was
happening.</p>

<p>“Yes, my mind was in an A-1 condition,
peace and good-will toward men, and everything
else, when all of a sudden Hank gives
his three locomotive whistles, and pulls for
the shore, followed by twenty grown-up men,
falling over bushes, jumping over boulders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
galloping and waving their arms in wild excitement,
Hank far in the lead.</p>

<p>“‘What in thunder?’ I said to myself.
‘That bank ain’t nowise loosening;’ when I
happened to look down, and there, on a little
bench, clapping his hands, sat that guerrilla-faced,
swivel-jointed rancher, and there was
coming up to him a black-and-tan dog, no bigger’n
three rats. He couldn’t see me, and the
boys couldn’t see him. They watched for that
bank to fall, and there wasn’t any fall, and
they waited, and they began cussing their good
old friend Hank, that had never failed them
once before.</p>

<p>“When I thought of Hank being thus
abused, just because a cussed little dog—a kind
of beast he ain’t never seen in his life before—has
run him out, my fighting-blood began
to run quick all around my veins and arteries,
and I thinks to myself, ‘Oh, you gol-darn potato-bug
assassin! You slayer of squ’sh bugs!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Here’s where you get the thirty-third degree
of Free and Accepted Masonry with all its
tips, spurs, right-angles and variations—so
mote it be!’</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the hour for blue checks to
run in my direction. I grabbed the elevator
wheel and sent the stream heavenward, started
her swinging, hoping to drop it right on the
back of Mr. Rancher’s neck. I didn’t intend
to push him into the bank and hold him there.
No, I was the slickest boy handling a stream
the country contained, and I thought, perhaps,
I could hit him in the neck with about
seven hundred assorted tons of water, and
leave his hat hanging in the air. I wanted to
do something real nice to him.</p>

<p>“Well, it was <em>me</em> that got it. I always told
the Boss he didn’t load the tripod heavy
enough. When I sent the stream up she teetered
for fair. It was like a camel buck-jumping.
There ain’t much give to three iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
legs, and so, friends, I was sitting up and down
times oftener than I could realize.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a bronc’ buster that wouldn’t
have yelled, ‘He’s a rider!’ if he’d seen me
stick to that machine. We crow-hopped on
the rocks back and forwards, and alleman’ all.
We pitched forward and back, and we did the
double teeter, and as for the stream—the
smack when she hit things sounded just like
a little small giant baby, nine hundred feet
high, clapping his hands with glee. Sometimes
through the whiz and howl I could hear
men’s voices asking why I done so, and they
no longer sounded like the voices of comrades
and friends.</p>

<p>“I was helpless as a child; couldn’t grab
lever, wheel nor nothing. Finally one leg
toppled off an edge of rock and then—!
Well, she shot the cook’s shanty across the
stream two hundred yards first whack. It was
so sudden it didn’t even put the fire out. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
boys took their solemn oaths the kitchen stove
went across, smoking as calm and peaceful as
anything, just like it had decided to take a little
fly. Nothing to interrupt business, but just
the kind of exercise you would think a cook-stove
would take. Yet they was astonished
that I should shoot a cook-stove across the
stream.</p>

<p>“While they was standing there astonished,
the old nozzle bucked ’way back, and plowed
a well in a bank ten feet away. I bet you that
stream could shoot a hole right up Niagara
Falls, and when she mixed it with the mess of
dirt and rock in that bank, kicking it backwards
at me, old Napoleon at Waterloo was a
dum poor effigy for Hy Smith. I couldn’t
see how it was ever going to be possible for
me to breathe again, and the awful roar and
swatting and smashing makes it queer how I
ever got to hear or think again.</p>

<p>“But she passed through that bank of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
dirt in no time, and all the fellows that was
asking, ‘Where’s he gone?’ found out. They
got the last of the bank. Men could show you
dents where pebbles no bigger’n buckshot had
been blown into them.</p>

<p>“The old monitor got real gay, and thought
she was a Fourth of July pin-wheel, and after
that there was nothing but water-works on
the whole cussed creek. She took from one
side to the other in quick swings. Billy, the
cook, said he saw a block of boards take wings
and sail right over Hooker’s Mountain.</p>

<p>“I was dumbfuzzled and geewhizzled, till
my head was full of curled hair and insect
powder. I hung on with all hands and feet
by instinct, like an insect, until finally we
steadied down and played in the same place
for half a minute, and I brushed some of the
water out of my eyes.</p>

<p>“Beside me was Hank, looking reproachful,
as much as to say, ‘I <em>thought</em> you knew your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
limit, Hy—but you must have stayed in town
<em>too</em> long last time.’</p>

<p>“Then the next thing that appeared was
that darned little black-and-tan dog that had
caused the whole trouble, followed by our
friend, the rancher. I pined to wash his
whiskers. But it was not to be. The monitor
had jacked all her levers and cogs by knocking
around.</p>

<p>“‘Come on,’ I yelped to the crowd—‘Come
on, you flapjack faces! Help me hold this
critter down.’</p>

<p>“They got a move on. We tied the monitor
and sent word to shut off the water. Whilst
we was all stepping on each other’s feet, I
thought I heard a mixture of sounds like small
roars and large ‘Ki-yi’s,’ but the farmer, he
was very busy, thinking we might catch on
to who did all this, and come down to his
cabin some night and take his whiskers as a
momentum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
“I had been pounded enough, so one of the
lads took my place. I stepped out. There
was a battle going on. That cussed little
black-and-tan terrier was snapping and flying
around poor old Hohankton, that had never
received anything but kind treatment in his
life, and scarcely knew what to make of this.
I hate a black-and-tan dog, anyway. I like
to see a dog with legs big enough and long
enough to support his body, and with a body
hefty enough to give the legs something to do.
This yapping little devil didn’t have none of
my sympathies. When I looked at the miserable
beast I felt something <em>had</em> to happen to
him.</p>

<p>“Just then he made a quick jump and nailed
old Hank by the nose, and at the very same
minute somebody hollered for me to come
and fix something.</p>

<p>“After I pounded my thumb and wrenched
my wrist getting the lever back in some shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
again, they stopped the water off, and the
country was saved!</p>

<p>“Then I grabbed that farmer and began to
recite facts about his career, while the boys
spit on their hands and took hold of shovels.
It looked like uncle farmer would lead an upright
life for some time, but he begged and
hollered and pled, so the fellows loosed him
from the position where we could best apply
shovels, and he explained that he didn’t go
for to do all this when he started, and we let
him up.</p>

<p>“He rose to his feet and apologized to us,
singly and collectively, and then he says,
‘Now I’ll just get little Pettie and ride right
along home,’ and he began to holler, ‘Pettie!
Pettie! Pettie!’ and all that come was old
Hank, who looked him straight in the face.</p>

<div id="ip_210" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="577" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“Little Pettie has departed,” I said. <span class="in1"><a href="#Page_211">Page 211</a></span></div></div>

<p>“‘Well, what has become of the durn little
coyote?’ says everybody, and then it just occurred
to me that I knew, so I went back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
where I had seen little Pettie grab old Hank
by the nose, and, sure enough, there was a
lovely little black tail!</p>

<p>“I brought it down to the rancher and I
said, ‘Little Pettie has departed, but he, she
or it leaves this for you as a souvenir.’</p>

<p>“The rancher says, ‘Gosh almighty!’ as if
he couldn’t believe his eyes. I held up the
tail, and I asked Hank:</p>

<p>“‘Here, little Hanky-Panky, did it eat the
rest of little Pettie?’ and Hank looked at the
tail and slouched off, with a kind of long and
non-complaining squeal.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says the Boss, brisk, ‘if we find any
more of little Pettie we’ll send it down to you,
but I guess that’s all you can collect of him
now.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, darnation!’ said the farmer, and he
brushed off the dust and dirt of his hands on
his trousers’ leg. ‘Well, say,’ says he, ‘I don’t
know whether to weep or to yell Hosanna!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
As for me, personally,’ he said, ‘that cussed
little dog has nigh chewed my fingers off,’ and
he showed us all kinds of bites on his fingers;
‘but,’ he says, ‘on the other hand, it’s my wife’s
pet, and every time one of the children lets
itself get bit by it, why, their mother raises
sin with them for tormentin’ it. If I had a
good lie ready I wouldn’t weep one bit. But
the circumstances and hullabaloos and waterfalls
and geysers I have seen in the last twenty
minutes have left my mind running in streaks.’</p>

<p>“We all looked at one another. We couldn’t
think of anything, so we shook our heads.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he, ‘perhaps by the time I get
home I will be able to explain how little Pettie
separated himself from this,’ and he twirled
the last remains. ‘Perhaps I can,’ he said. ‘I
don’t bear you boys the slightest grudge no
more. I can’t. I set this dog on your pig
a-purpose, and I can’t pretend to be at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
sorry that your pig et him up.’ He shook his
head again, and fixed his hat on.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says he, ‘matrimony is the mother
of invention. I reckon I’ll get out of it somehow.
Good-by, boys!’ And he took one more
look at Pettie’s tail and put it in his pocket.
‘If anything happens to me you will know
who it is by that,’ said he.</p>

<p>“As for the rest of us, we enjoyed ourselves
figuring on just <em>what</em> that rancher could explain.
You can bring home a dog and say
its tail has been cut off someway, but to bring
home a tail and say the dog has been cut off
someway is a hard proposition to work on the
female mind that has lived on a ranch twenty
years or so.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FATAL GUM<br />

<span class="subhead">A SERIO-COMEDY OF LIGHT FINGERS AND

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Zeke Scraggs</span> had been working out
on the dry patch, where it was a long
ways between drinks, and lukewarm water
from a canteen no particular comfort. He
complained, and I produced a discovery in
the shape of a tin-foil-wrapped package of
chewing-gum marked “Lily Sweet.”</p>

<p>“If you chew a piece of that when you’re
dry, Scraggy,” I said, “it will stave off thirst
for some time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scraggs received the offering in his
large palm, and poked it with the forefinger
of his other hand.</p>

<p>“Yaas,” he said; “y-a-a-s. But it’s dangerous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
“Dangerous?”</p>

<p>“Horrible. You don’t ketch me minglin’
myself with no ‘Lily Sweets.’ <em>I</em> consider the
lily of the field how she grows. You wouldn’t
believe that anything that sounds so innercent
could be the tee-total ruin of a large, dark-complected
tin-horn, with a pair of musstaches
like Injun-polished buffler horns,
would you?”</p>

<p>Like almost anybody else would have done,
I said I wouldn’t.</p>

<p>“Well, it was,” said Zeke. “If you could
see that gam, and compare him to this here
package of choon’-gum, you wouldn’t ever
guess that either one could do much of anything
to t’other; yet I can a tale relate of that
combination that would make each particler
hair stand up-ended, like the squills of the
frightful porkypine.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” said I, being but a youth.</p>

<p>“You got any hairs that’s particler by nature?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
No? Well, then, I’ll spread this terrific
osculation of the connimgulated forces of
Nature befo’ you, as Charley says. My kind
of narrative is the plain, unvarnished tale.
Folks that tell a varnished tale is apt to sit
on the varnish before it’s dry, and they’ll stick
to it, come cold fact or red-hot argyment;
whilst I’m always willin’ to prune, cross-harrer,
revise or alter accordin’ to my victim’s
feelin’s. That is, of course, if they go to
corner me, which, between gentlemen, is a
low-cut outrage. But this business about the
gam is dead straight. I had relinquished all
amusements and was livin’ quiet in order to
save money, before I got acquainted with the
facts.</p>

<p>“First place, comes a female missionary out
to the ranch, and she was a corkin’ fine-lookin’
nice young woman, too, who tackled me on
the subject of chewin’ terbackker. She had
me all tangled up in my own rope and double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
left-sided front and back before the clock
struck one.</p>

<p>“I tried to arger that nobody wouldn’t care
whether I chewed terbackker or grass, so
long’s I was happy and doin’ no harm. But
that turned out not to be true. She said
so.</p>

<p>“Then I tried to reach her womanly compassion
by tearfully expoundin’ how I’d miss
my cut of plug a day; I never touched her.
Hers was a new religion. It had a different
figger on the back from any I’d had dealt to
me before. Seems it weren’t a sin to chew,
but it was the control I’d lost over myself that
put me in the hole. I had just to git command
of my mind and everything would come
at me, like a North Ca’lina town’s nigger’s
dogs chasin’ a three-legged cat up an alley.</p>

<p>“‘But ma’am,’ say I, ‘I’ve knocked off before;
an’, as for control over my mind, durin’
the hull spell me an’ Star Plug was separated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
friends had to hold me to prevent me goin’ in
an’ robbin’ my own grip. Control of my
mind,’ says I, fightin’ noble, ‘why, you could
’a’ sicked a burglar on me, an’ he couldn’t have
found no such thing on my person. I didn’t
have no mind. I walked up an’ down, day
and night, in that man’s town, like a ravin’
maniac stupefied by his halloocinashuns. All
that passed beneath my shinin’ dome was:
“Oh for a chew! Oh for a chew! Oh for
a choo-choo-choo-choo! Whoeep! Brakes!”
And when the cars went over the switch or a
cayuse cantered up, they said: “Terbackker,
terbackker, terbackker,” to my famished ears.
All I wished was that the houses was built of
plug, and all I thought of was that I could
get earnest with an ax. That’s <em>all</em> I <em>could</em>
think—all!’</p>

<p>“‘But you must use the control!’ says she,
eager.</p>

  <div class="caption">“‘I will not use terbackker,’ says little Zekey Scraggs.” <span class="in1"><a href="#Page_219">Page 219</a></span></div></div>

<p>“‘You mean, ma’am,’ I says, ‘that I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
seek out a quiet place, clench my fists, grind
my teeth to a feather-edge and strain my suspenders
to the bustin’ point in one calamitous
effort to think I’m not thinking?’</p>

<p>“‘Precisely!’ says she, victorious. ‘You
Western men have such a ready grip on essentials
that it is a delight to be your guide.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Uncle Tom and the dogs a-bitin’
him!’ says I to myself. ‘Lead on!’ I took off
my hat aloud and bowed to within two of my
noses to the ground. ‘To be able to foller so
gentle and able a guide straight to perdition
is a joy,’ says I. ‘I quit the class of roominants
for two weeks. I will not use terbackker.
No!’ says little Zekey Scraggs. ‘There’s
my hand on it, ma’am.’</p>

<p>“And she just turned pink with joy. She
was an awful nice little gal. Only she was so
jam-full of knowledge that it was hard for her
to understand things.</p>

<p>“Having put up this job on myself, I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to our storekeep’ and called for my time. I
knew I’d need bright lights and excitement
for a while. I begun to feel already that a
chew wouldn’t go bad.</p>

<p>“There was the storekeep’ gazin’ fixedly at
a book; his lips was movin’, but he seemed in
a kind of rapture. When I hollered to him,
he jumped all over and barked at me like a
dog. At the same time he grabbed up a
cigareet, stuck it in his mouth, took it out,
looked at it and fired it down again.</p>

<p>“A light broke on me. ‘So she got you,
too?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Hooppitty Hoppitty Hippitty Yer-hoop!’
says he. ‘That’s just what she’s done!
I’m three days out. Not a smell of smoke in
three days! My soul has gone away and
won’t have any more truck with me. I don’t
know who I am, nor why. I’ve been trying
for an hour to find out how much three and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
two make. Take your money and leave me to
my fate.’</p>

<p>“With this picture in my mind I broke for
town. Half-way there I was chawin’ a latigo-strap
like a wolf. When I hit the street, I
jumped through the drug-store door.</p>

<p>“‘What you got for a man that’s quit chewin’?’
I gasps to the boss.</p>

<p>“‘Franky Frenchman’s Fool-Killer,’ says
he—and with that he turns his head and expectorates
satisfactorily into the spittoon.</p>

<p>“Seeing him, I near died of a broken heart.</p>

<p>“‘The next crack will be at your expense,’
I told him. ‘You hike out somethin’ for my
case,’ I says. He shoved me out a package,
just like that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scraggs poked my gift.</p>

<p>“Just like that. I put the whole bizzee in
my trap and chomped on it like a lion. I
walked around the town, chompin’ on it. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
waved my jaws till my face ached. Seemed to
me like I’d never done anythin’ in all my life
but bite Injy-rubber. And then I pushed
madly for the first stud-poker game.</p>

<p>“When I got there, nothin’ was movin’.
This here tin-horn I mention was polishing
his muss-tache with both hands, whilst he
talked to a few hangers-on.</p>

<p>“I became ashamed of that choon’-gum and
I stuck it under the table, very sly and surreptishus.
I felt like a man again.</p>

<p>“‘Fire the engine up!’ says I. ‘Gimme five
stacks to practise on.’</p>

<p>“The gam hopped gleeful toward the table
and give the drawer a yank. She stuck. He
cussed and pulled harder. She came open
with a jerk and a kind of a long, sticky
s-m-aaa-ack, followed the strings of gray.</p>

<p>“The gam arose from where he’d sot on his
backbone and looked at the drawer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
“‘We’re not doin’ any business to-day,’ says
he, showing me my little eagle-bird.</p>

<p>“‘What’s happened to the trade?’ says I.</p>

<p>“He simply p’inted to the hunk of gum
(which I had most unforchinit jammed ag’in’
the drawer).</p>

<p>“‘My wildest fancies have got exceeded,’
says he. ‘Do you want to hear a weird and
wilful tale of woe?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course not,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says he, ‘here’s the way she come
up. I’m a lost one in the wilderness out at a
telegraph station. I see where I get my talents
buried in a napkin made of sole-leather,
hence I get handy with a deck of cards in
front of the lookin’-glass. My work is so
good after a while that I lose my whole salary
to myself, and yet watchin’ careful all the time
in the lookin’-glass. I’m fit to handle the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
steamboat trade, but I aims higher: I buy me
a ticket to Noo York and hunt up a place
where they hew to the line, let the chips fall
where they will.</p>

<p>“‘“What’s your noo box o’ tricks?” says
the Murphy that run the joint.</p>

<p>“‘“Well,” says I, “nothin’ new, but the
good old reliable line. The world is my
oyster, as Hamlet says, and I’ve got openers.”</p>

<p>“‘“H’m,” says he, makin’ a fat man’s shift
in his chair and pushin’ his seegar into the
other corner of his face. “I want you to understand
this is a dead-straight game run here,
my bucko—yet you look good—s’pose I’ve
come in an’ laid thirty cents or so on the king,
coppered. Lift the joker out of that deck an’
le’s see what happens.”</p>

<p>“‘He threw me a pack and I riffled and
boxed ’em.</p>

<p>“‘“Why, you lose,” says I, much surprised
as the king came out open on the turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
“‘“And not so worse,” says he. “Play on!”</p>

<p>“‘I slid ’em out of the box to the last card.
“You only lost your footin’ once,” says he.
“The way you beat my corner play was a little
obvious. Exercise your little finger till it’s
soopler. You can handle a roll to-night.
But mind this,” says he as he grunted himself
on his feet, “this is a dead-straight house. If
anybuddy <em>ketches</em> you bein’ technical, we
jump you, from me to the cop on watch. You
get five per cent.”</p>

<p>“‘Well, sir, that was the loveliest little
bower of rosebuds you ever smelt! Checks
was joolry. We didn’t have change for
nothin’ below a fifty-dollar bill. Our line
of customers was these tur’ble knowin’ young
men of the world, who’d stood the terrific experience
of a college careerin’. They was a
darin’ outfit. They was so fast they couldn’t
help talk about the pace they was hittin’, and
what they didn’t know about the game of faro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
was my business. It was like bein’ knocked
down in the street by a strong man and have
money pushed into your clothes. I did things
at that table that never happened before in a
civilized community. I was so youthful, you
know, and it was a constant problem to me
whether they’d stand for biting off the corner
of a card to make things come my way.</p>

<p>“‘I run in rhinecaboos that ’ud make a
heathen Scandahonian farmer fall off his hay-wagon,
but them men of the world simply
contributed yallerbacks—oh, good old yallerbacks!—beautiful
to the eye; soft to the touch;
<em>so</em> encouragin’ to the feelin’s! I reckoned I’d
buy the durned old Western Union an’ get
even with the cuss who used to pound it to me
from up the line—Ouch! vanished dream!
Sweet vision stuck to earth by that con-cussed,
snappy, stringy, bouncy, mud-colored foolish
food fer flighty females you see before you!’</p>

<p>“At this p’int,” said Mr. Scraggs, “he shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
his finger at my gum, breathin’ hard an’ glitterin’
his eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir!’ says he. ‘There lies the cause
of my roon! And such a fiddlin’, triflin’ stuff
to wreck a man!’ He got some of his breath
back. ‘You orter ask “How?”’ says he, ‘and
I reply, “By contractin’ the habit”’—‘Not of
gnawin’ it’—he adds hasty, ‘but steppin’ on it.
Here was I sittin’ on sunset clouds and floatin’
over beautiful scenery, till there comes a cold
blast of the winds of chance, and from that
moment my path in life was strewed with the
discard from rosy lips. For two solid weeks
I did nothin’ but scuff my feet or flag a shine-stand
to get rid of the day’s gatherin’ of gum.
Them Eye-talians used to grin in a way that
made me want an open season on furriners, as
I cantered up to ’em, smicky-smacky, smicky-smacky,
trailin’ soft gray hairs behind me
like a retired minister’s whiskers.</p>

<p>“‘They’d look up at the sky and make dago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
remarks, whilst they curried my feet with a
brick, till the cold sweat of mortification
melted my b’iled collar. And once a flap-doodle
actor goat, with a red, white and blue
hatband, got gay and told me not to use such
naughty words about these tributes from the
mouth of beauty. I swatted the air where
he’d been when I started to hit him an’ he
took me by most of my trousers and turned me
ten somersaults. How was I to know he was
Honest Mike, the Deck Hand, who chucked
the villain over Brooklyn Bridge every night
and Saturday matinée?</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ll cut it short. No matter where
I fled, the fiend pursued me. I went to the
opery one night, to get my frazzled nerves
soothed by the champion yelpers of the pack.
For two solid hours I lived untroubled, not
even worried by the show, as I couldn’t understand
a word of it and nobuddy on the
stage had complaints too deep to sing about;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
but comin’ out, me enemy waited on the edge
of a step for me and I landed astride of a
stout lady’s neck, beggin’ her pardon and
fightin’ a half-dozen men for five minutes.
When I explained, even the stout lady
laughed.</p>

<p>“‘The boss at my joint cussed himself into
asthma, wondering what the sticky stuff,
tracked all over his new seven-dollar-a-yard
carpet, was.</p>

<p>“‘But I ain’t goin’ to weary you with trifles.
One day the boss tipped me off that
there was a bunch of alum-eyes due that evenin’;
he said they was fellers that had took the
college course, but recovered, and that the
bowlegged elephant song and dance that extracted
money from our regulars would be
looked upon with reproach by the new-comers.
I got nervous. Playin’ ag’in’ them little first-crow
roosters had been bad practice. I
soaked my hands in warm water and prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
as best I could, but when I saw that gang before
me I knew why they was called alum-eyes.
They puckered my soul up, my hands
got too wet with sweat for business—you know
your fingers has got to be not too dry, to slip,
and not too wet, to stick, if you’re turnin’ out
high-grade work.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I was excited, yet it was a reel
pleasure to be up against reel men.</p>

<p>“‘I had a habit of running my fingers over
the rung of my chair, to keep ’em in right
shape. ’Twas a thing nobuddy could complain
of, and the game just held on to its hat
and flew. How much money you had was the
limit, and to put my little bank on the other
side of the river, quick, was the idea of the
alum-eyes.</p>

<p>“‘I forgot everythin’. I was fair hollerin’
inside for joy. My buckers had a good square
chance to catch me at it, if they could, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
was haulin’ money when—well, Fortune had
patted me on the back with one hand, while
she got ready with a black-jack in the other.
In my state of feelin’ I put a heel, a chewin’-gum-covered-heel,
on the rung of that chair
and took it off again, without noticin’. As
the play stood, the outfit had me whipsawed.
I drug my fingers over the rung of that chair,
that chewin’-gum-covered-rung, without noticing;
then I wiggled my fingers in a Chinee
ketch-as-ketch-can over the box and raised
’em with a playin’-card firmly stuck to each
finger. <em>Then</em> I noticed, yes; and everybody
noticed. Silence fell six foot deep. One of
them alum-eyes says:</p>

<p>“‘“That may be magnifercent, but it ain’t
Hoyle.”</p>

<p>“‘And I excused myself by ducking under
the table and jumping over the banisters.</p>

<p>“‘Once on the street, I hoopled her for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
corner. My play was to wait till the crowd
went out, and then see the old man, who had
a rubber-band on my roll.</p>

<p>“‘I thought I’d peek around the corner until
all was clear, then rush the boss with my
hard-luck game of talk, extract a little of the
juice of the root of evil from him, then fold
up my legs like a jack-rabbit and silently lift
myself through the breeze, back to the sagebush—back
to where the prairie-dog and the
owl and the rattlesnake live in harmony together—never
excepting the rattlesnake, so
long’s there’s plenty of young dogs and owls.</p>

<p>“‘The game must have busted when I took
the fence, for here come the bunch of alum-eyes
right up the street. I had the curiosity
to wait and hear what they was talkin’ about,
as I had a corner to duck behind when they
come close. Well, I waited, and didn’t hear
nothin’ I’d care to write home to mother.
They made me so cussed mad, I overstayed my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
time. Just when they got within range, I
started to hop swiftly backwards. But I
didn’t. No. My feet had grew fast to that
sidewalk. Seems the city had been mending
the block pavement, as usual, and some
horney-souled son of toil had spilt a square
yard of coal-tar on the sidewalk. Me to the
middle of the coal-tar district, of course—you
can chew coal-tar, you know; I’ve done it.</p>

<p>“‘So, as I remarked, I didn’t gracefully
side-step. Exactly not. I gave one yank and
landed with my knees up in the air. Them
feet was riveted fast, you bet, and my joints
just had to yield accordin’.</p>

<p>“‘“What is this we have?” said one alum-eye.</p>

<p>“‘There was a gas lamp on the corner.
They knew me by my face.</p>

<p>“‘“Are you going to deal flagstones with
your feet?” asks one of them.</p>

<p>“‘Let’s pull down the blinds. It was their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
whirl at the bat. They brought all the folks,
includin’ the old man and Tommy the cop.</p>

<p>“‘They yee-hooed on my feet till I had to
holler for mercy. Then they sat on the curb
and rocked and hollered like the pack of fools
they were. They tried to lift my shoulders
up, but found that my coat had took a violent
affection for the sidewalk, too. Some of ’em
didn’t even try for the curbstone then. They
rolled around on the sidewalk and kicked their
legs, whilst I frayed my vocal chords readin’
their customs and habits to ’em.</p>

<p>“‘But I was in a runnin’ noose; the harder
I cussed at ’em, the worse they laughed.</p>

<p>“‘“Ain’t he the slick one, though!” says
the old man, holdin’ on to his stummick with
both hands. “Don’t do nothin’ more to him
for a minute, boys, or the coroner’ll be sittin’
on me.”</p>

<p>“‘Every time I gee-nashed my teeth an’
tried to reach ’em they waltzed on one leg and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
shrieked. There must ’a’ been nigh three
hundred fools watchin’ and havin’ the time of
their lives. Little messenger-boys was there,
the night-watchmen took a peep, ladies with
a past improved a shinin’ present, the dago
shoeblacks heard the racket and come runnin’
up and hollered, “Choon-gum extract! Ten
a cent!”</p>

<p>“‘And there I lay, flat on my back, with my
knees in the air, scart to move, because I
couldn’t wiggle a finger without the crowd
throwin’ a fit. Oh, murder! Le’s cut it!
They unlaced my shoes and snaked me out of
my coat, and instead of bein’ sad at them pathetical
shoes and coat lying in the coal-tar,
the boss fell over sideways and the rest
was too feeble to stop me as I broke away. I
made that block in two stocking-footed leps.</p>

<p>“‘I had a hundred or two in my pants. I
bought three dollars’ worth of coat and shoes
from a second-hand store for fifteen dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
and a promise that if anything happened I
wouldn’t mention the shop to the police.
Then I come here, far from the gadding
crowds, far from the lady with the developed
jaw-swing, and I get—that.’</p>

<p>“Here,” said Mr. Scraggs, “he p’inted to
my chewin’-gum and wiped his white brow
off with his white handkercher, and he says:
‘Have we come to this?’</p>

<p>“I swallered hard and looked at him.</p>

<p>“‘Have you such a thing as a plug of terbackker
in your possession?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ says he, surprised. ‘I have.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ says I, ‘ruther than to further add
to your troubles, I’ll break my word to a lady—gimme
that plug! We haven’t come to this—this
has come to us.’</p>

<p>“So I explained, and he opened his stock
exchange. I reckon he was right about the
bad effects of chewin’-gum, too, or maybe
what’s a medal winner in N’ York ain’t art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
west of the Missouri. Anyhow, you don’t
hear me kickin’ about that nice missionary
young lady. If I cared for joolry, I’d be
wearin’ that tin-horn’s diamon’ chest protector
right now. Gum has different effects on different
people. ’Twas fatal to his constitooshun.”</p>

<span class="subhead">BLESSED BE THE PEACEMAKERS<br />

<span class="subhead">THE QUEST FOR QUIET ON THE PART OF
THE HUMAN CONCERTINA</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“The</span> peaceful season has come around
again,” said Mr. Scraggs. “It does
that every year. It is a good thing to have
a certain date to be peaceful on; you prepare
for it, put all troublesome things away, and
wind up, as I usually do, with four friends
trying to hold me down because I feel so light
in the head.</p>

<p>“Peace is one of the finest things on earth,
but the makin’ of it will never be confined to
one of these here monopolies. Listen!
What better could a man do than go into a
home being tore wide open by the dissensions
and discussions of one husband and one wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
using such domestic articles as flat-irons, coal-scuttles,
brooms and the like of that, upon
each other, and extract from the dust one
large, smooth, round, white hunk of peace?
It is nice to think of.</p>

<p>“I remember Long John. He was a feller
built on the concertina plan. When he sat
down in a chair he didn’t look like a man
more’n seven feet high, but when he got up,
and up, and more up, he was that kind of build
that made little Bill holler, the first time he
saw the ack, ‘How much more of you is there
down cellar?’ And Bill said to me on the
quiet: ‘Old Gabe will have to play an oncore
if he expects John to get up before the resurrection
is all over.’</p>

<p>“But John had a disposition that couldn’t
be beat. He was for peace all the time. Bits
of men that wouldn’t more’n come up to his
waist used to talk to him as rough as they liked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
and John wouldn’t give them one word back.
He simply hit them a slam, and then there was
peace, you bet your life.</p>

<p>“But it was done out of pure good-natur.
‘They got no business to talk like that to nobody,’
says John, ‘and I can correc’ them without
it looking anything like a fight. Ain’t you
noticed that that stops ’em from being sassy?’
It sure did, but I lived in fear and tremblin’
some feller would be an inch nearer than John
cal’lated and would remain quiet for several
million years. That would have broke his
heart.</p>

<p>“Well, John put in a solid eight months
without ever pinting a foot toward town.
Then he collected and went off for a little
quiet trip on his own hook. He said that nobody
could ask for a better people than we
were, yet we was kind of rough in our ways,
and he wanted to see domestic felicity, and the
soothing inflooence of Woman. That there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
was a strain in his ideas that made him need
kind and gentle treatment oncet in so often.</p>

<p>“It ain’t, perhaps, necessary for me to say
that I have been exposed to the inflooence of
seventy or eighty Mrs. Scraggs for enough
number of years to heave a sigh on what was
comin’ to John; but I never guessed how complete
his whole idea of the way this universe
runs would be ruined.</p>

<p>“Off goes Johnny Boy, dressed up in his best
black suit, that looked as if it had been made
for a statue of a life-sized giant. The sleeves
hung down to the middle of his fingers, the
pants rolled up six inches at the bottom, and,
as he was a ga’nt critter, there was enough
stuff in them clothes to make it look as if he
could turn right around inside them without
attracting attention.</p>

<p>“And he come back.</p>

<p>“This is what happened. He come into the
bull-pen slower than usual. He sat down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the bunk, with his face completely surrounded
by hands, and he never opened his yorp till
long after we’d et our supper. Then he took
me by the arm, and says, ‘Scraggsy, you been
my friend for a long time. Come out till I
tell you something.’</p>

<p>“I went out and he smoked his cigareet for
another half-hour until I had to say: ‘If you
have got anything real to tell me, John, why
don’t you do it to-night, while we’re sitting out
here so comfortable in the frost?’</p>

<p>“Says he: ‘I got up there all right. It was
a nice town. There was swimming. There
was peace. There was sidewalks, and fellers
wearing strange hats. Everything was there,
and I think,’ he says, ‘I was more scared of the
things I didn’t know whether they could happen
or not than I was of the things I knew
could happen.</p>

<p>“‘My soul had all the fuz roped off of it.
I was positive I would never more take two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
wraps around a cayuse with them legs of mine,
and chase a skitty steer some more. “No,”
says I, “cow-punching is a lost art.” A feller
gets all broke up and tackled with rheumatism
before he’s—he’s—well, I ain’t sixty yet,
by a durn sight. Anyhow, a feller gets broke
up any time, and I think of those lovely homes
and nice beds, and it seemed great.</p>

<p>“‘The gent behind the counter of the hotel
shoved a book and a pen at me. I looked at
’em, wonderin’ if it was an autograft album.
The little gals uster have ’em when I was
young, and you put your John Hancock down
and then something about the rose is red and
the violets blue—I forget the rest.</p>

<p>“‘I felt queer. It didn’t seem like a man
of my size oughter be writing sich sentiments
in a large book with lots of people looking on.</p>

<p>“‘Howsumever I done it, and the clerk says
to me, “You come from the playful districts,
just outlying the land of fun, don’t you?” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
he added that too much gayety weren’t a good
thing.</p>

<p>“‘He came to about ten words about it,
when I took the flat of my hand and patted
him on the back of his head. His nose bled
all over the book, and everybody seemed to
think there was a kick comin’.</p>

<p>“‘At last they showed me where I was
wrong, and instead of fussing around that
pesky hotel, I spent the night in a calaboose.
It was one of the pleasantest little jails I ever
inhabited—airy, kind of roomy, when I lay
on the floor with my head in one corner and
my feet in the other—but, toward morning, I
got restless and horrible hungry. I hadn’t et
the night before, forgetting my supper in the
fuss they made about that autograft album, so
I shoved my bird-cage door off its hinges and
started for grub.</p>

<p>“‘I come upon the jailer eating his midnight
meal—pie, cake, eggs—everything. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
looked at me and reached for his gun. I
took hold of him and reached for his lunch.
I et that lunch and gave him one iron dollar,
handed him the door, and said, “You keep
this, so you don’t work any racket on me
stealing your property; or, if you like, I will
walk around town with it and you can swear
your affidavit that I am still behind the jail
door—if you only stand in front of me and
look.”</p>

<p>“‘He was a nervous kind of critter that
wasn’t fit to take care of a bunch of sheep, let
alone running a jail. Couldn’t get anything
out of him. He was excited, so I spread them
bars on the door apart, stuck his head in, let
them snap back on his neck and sung him,
<i>Come, Birdie, Come and Live With Me</i>!</p>

<p>“‘He certainly was a comic-looking jailer,
sitting back there with his head peeking
through the door. The other fellers in there
laughed to beat anything, and wanted me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
cut ’em loose, but I couldn’t do that—havin’
come to the town for peace and quiet.</p>

<p>“‘Howsumever, I recovered the goods they
took from me, and fed the boys a little out of
the thimbleful of high jumps I carried in my
behind pocket, until everybody was singing,
dancing jigs, and so happy that it did sure
look like a little bird-cage filled with the merriest
chirpers that ever teetered on a limb.</p>

<p>“‘Come daybreak, I says good-by to the
crowd and started out to see the city. I
turned into the business district, but the stores
wasn’t open yet, so I naturally meandered anywheres
my fancy led me.</p>

<p>“‘Some of them nice houses were sending
up a curl of smoke for early breakfast, and
some of them was tight shut, where the fellers
that led easy lives weren’t up yet, but was
sleeping peacefully in security, and I felt over-lonesome.
Seemed like I hadn’t got what was
coming to me, that I couldn’t have a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
shack with red roses on it, and some nice, kind
woman—that would think a durn sight more
of me than I was wuth—to keep my feet out
of the drafts for the rest of my days.</p>

<p>“‘It was a purty sunrise. It ketched holt
of the trees, it scattered red on the window-panes.
The chickens was crowin’ and cacklin’
around. The dogs come out and give me
a wet wallop on the back of my hand, or
chased after me till I had to send them home.
And the cats was sitting up on top of the fence-posts
waiting for a friendly scratch on the
back, and I did feel my life was wasted.</p>

<p>“‘So I hiked out of that to a hill I see in
the distance to think things over, and they was
more’n plenty. Shaking my head to myself
and thinking of what I had lost, I happened
to look at my watch and found out I had near
lost my lunch, for one thing; so I did the turn
back to town at a good, easy lope.</p>

<p>“‘Them young ladies that waited on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
table took care of me in good shape. They
called me “Grandpaw,” but it weren’t in no
way sassy, and I give ’em a five-dollar gold-piece
to get some of the green, blue, red and
yeller flyabout things that gals like; and the
men they was nice and polite to me, too, till,
by and by, here comes a committee of five to
wait on me, and explain I should oughter go
back to jail.</p>

<p>“‘Again it looked as if I should have to
subdue some trouble, but only a minute. I
showed them that the finish of their jail was
ineveetible, if they kept sticking a man in who
was bound and determined to carry off a hunk
of their jail every time he wanted to come out
again; and, more’n that, would feel it his
bounden duty to shoot, and would shoot, and,
as a matter of fact, <em>did</em> shoot a hole through
the hat of the most pushin’ of the crowd; and
I simply says: “Instead of all this fuss and fiddle
about nothing except them sentiments I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
wrote in your hotel-book, which seem to displease
you, let us have a little treat.”</p>

<p>“‘It is no use talking, there is plenty of good
in everybody. We had that little treat, and
they found out who I was, and, by-and-by, one
feller says: “We have got you noosed as an inhabitant
of this here town. Don’t you try to
break away, but remember you have got your
picket-pin in your own hands. Turn yourself
loose, and please us all the more.” So that
day was right pleasant and cheerful.</p>

<p>“‘The town paper come out with a notice
that the eminent citizen, “Long John,” alias
“Texas Brown,” alias “Whipsaw Brown,”
alias “Johnny-on-the-seven-spot Brown,” had
been overtaken by the town of Abraham Lincoln,
and that for the present the map of said
town contained him as its most important
business center.</p>

<p>“‘The shops all shut up, and that town and
me had a fly through space together that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
citizens won’t forget for several weeks. But
when I woke next morning, I says to myself:
“This looks like the same old thing, whilst I
came here hunting for peaceful domestic
joys.”</p>

<p>“‘So I got up in the cool of the morning
with scarcely a pain in my head, and sails out
to more retiring districts.</p>

<p>“‘I saw before me the nicest little house you
ever did see. There was all kinds of posies
in front of it; its fence was as shiny as a set
of false teeth; the grass was cut short and tidy.
It weren’t painted too many colors. In fact,
it was just right, and feelin’ poetic, I said
aloud: “O happiness, here’s where thou hast
planted thy stakes. Inside this small claim,
with all its tips, spurs, angles and variations,
there sure runs a pasture of high-grade, free
millin’”—but I got no further, for from out
that shell that looked so good to me there come
a yell like as if a mounting-lion had switched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
his tail into a wolf-trap. A sound of breaking
furniture come to my ears. Also, something
as if a man was cussin’ from the very inside of
his heart outward, and I gathered that a lady
was either being beat by her husband, or else
was beating her husband. Of course, in the
former case, I was bound to interfere, not
knowin’ the rules of married life.</p>

<p>“‘I waved my right foot in the air and slipped
the door off its hinges, and there appeared
before me sich a scene as I never would suppose
could appear before anybody in a house
with posies in front of it, and vines crawling
over it, and sich nice, clean winders.</p>

<p>“‘The lady, who was a stout-built female
something under six feet, had a little dark-complected
man under the crook of her arm,
and whilst she spanked him with the stove-lid
she hollered “Help!” and “Murder!” That
poor little—I mean to say, that scoundrel—had
kicked over most of the truck that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
movable, the cat and dog was gobblin’ what
would have been breakfast if this unhappy dispute
hadn’t come about, and they was growling
and snapping and spitting, too.</p>

<p>“‘There weren’t no peace about it.</p>

<p>“‘Just as my eyes got used to this, the little
man made a violent effort, caught the lady by
one foot, and pushed. She lost her balance
and fell agin the crockery-box. That lost its
balance and fell on both of them. All I could
see was two pair of feet. Nothing could be
more painful than to see a lady covered with
crockery and a large closet.</p>

<p>“‘I got in front to straighten things up
again, and the gentleman bit me in the leg. I
called “Peace!” to him, but he didn’t care.
Then I got the thing half-straightened up—you
will notice by this lump under my right
ear where the lady took me one with the stove-lid.</p>

<div id="ip_252" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_273.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“Don’t you dast touch my husband!” says she. <span class="in1"><a href="#Page_253">Page 253</a></span></div></div>

<p>“‘I kept right on with the good work, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
although it seems onreasonable to the untutored,
and yet absolutely necessary under the
conditions, I put one foot on the lady and
pulled as much as I could of the gent away
from her.</p>

<p>“‘Something whizzed over my head and
took my brand-new Stetson right along with
it into the fire that the upset cook-stove had
started. My foot slipped on a piece of pertater,
and I come down right in the middle of
domestic bliss. The lady wrapped one hand
in my hair, and hit me with the other fair hand
that weighed about eight pounds.</p>

<p>“‘“Don’t you dast touch my husband!” says
she. “You big brute, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“‘“Ma’am,” says I, kind of jerky—for the
little dark-complected feller had squirmed
loose and was basting me with a section of
stove-pipe, accusing me of striking his wife—“ma’am,”
I says, “I don’t hardly reckon you
are doing the right thing by me. I only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
wanted to keep you from harm”—and them
was my last words.</p>

<p>“‘My good intentions had soured on their
stomachs. The pair of them done more
things with me in one-half minute than a
monkey could think of in one-half a month.
Most of my scratches and eighty per cent. of
the cuts is healed. They spoiled that bed of
posies by dragging me over them, and I put
the fence a little out of plumb by trying to regain
some of the dignity that ought naturally
to belong to a man. That is to say, I took hold
of the fence and tried to stand up, but me and
two of the pickets hit the middle of the road.
I carried those pickets with me just because
I was dazed.</p>

<p>“‘I turned up at the hotel still holdin’ ’em,
and all the male citizens there assembled expressed
their surprise in one voice. Them
nice waiter-ladies got rags and things, and
patched me up the best they could. The hotel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
man loaned me two drinks, and it seemed as if
somewhere in the back part of me, where the
real “Long John Brown” had took to the brush
during the scrimmage, there was a stir, and by-and-by
I come to.</p>

<p>“‘Immejitely I whooped up them steps to
my room, packed my grip and come down
front again. I ain’t braggarty a bit when I
say them people was sorry to see me go, and
coaxed me to try another whirl.</p>

<p>“‘They almost had me, when down the
street in the distance here come that fine-built,
up-standing female and the little dark-complected
man, and I heard the woman holler to
a neighbor that they was out to catch an eight-foot-high,
bow-legged critter, with hair and
whiskers like a billy-goat, that had broke into
their house without cause or reason, smashed
all the crockery, knocked the stove into junk
and inflicted upon their persons some injuries
they could show, and some they wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
“‘I turned to the crowd at the bar, and says,
“That is the piece of beautiful domestic life I
tried to help. Are you fellers now goin’ to
stand for me?”—and them fellers put down
their glasses, and walked so fast they got jabbed
in the doorway, lightin’ out of that.</p>

<p>“‘One lad says to me, “You know I’m your
friend, but—”</p>

<p>“‘“Yes,” I says, “I know you are my friend,
and you know that nothing could hurt my feelings
worse than to see a friend of mine get
hurt, so you are putting out where it ain’t likely
to happen.”</p>

<p>“‘“Yes,” he says, kind of hurried. “That’s
it. That lady’s run for mayor of this town
twice without anybody asking her, or saying
anything about it. She’s elected herself twice,
only casting one vote. We keep the City Hall
doors locked all the time. I meant to tell you
that the town wasn’t really run. She is, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
might say, a determined character,” and, he
says, in a greater hurry yet, “Good-by.”</p>

<p>“‘The barkeeper had took down cellar, so
I says “Good-by” to my reflection in the lookin’-glass
and skipped out the back way, behind
barns and sheds and barrels, so that lady
couldn’t see me, and hid in an empty coal-bin
at the station until it come time for my train,
and here I be,’ says John. ‘Here I be,
Scraggsy, old man; and, while I ain’t in no
way convinced but what domestic felicity is
the one thing on earth, yet I wish I hadn’t been
so biggoty, and had asked you a few facts concerning
the female species before I started to
put my notions into practice.’</p>

<p>“‘Goin’ to stay quiet on the ranch now?’ I
asked him.</p>

<p>“He rolled a cigareet with determination,
and he answers, ‘Mebbe,’ and the only other
words I heard from him was when he stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
on a shoe in his bare feet and come down on
some place that was sore from the kind attentions
of his lady friend, and he strangled
for three minutes, gritting his teeth so I could
hear ’em squeak in the darkness, and then he
says:</p>

<p>“‘Blessed be the peacemakers!’”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
